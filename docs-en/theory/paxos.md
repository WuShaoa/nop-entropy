# Paxos Algorithm Research Report

The Paxos algorithm is not long, but it consists of only a few short sentences. It appears to be like sacred text because we do not fully understand the rules and their underlying intentions. Why does it work? Would the system fail if we don't follow these rules? The fundamental nature of distributed systems is characterized by birth and death in an unpredictable environment, but the Paxos algorithm somehow manages to establish a consistent consensus world within this chaos. It seems almost divine, like a miracle. However, humans are limited by their finite experiences and cannot achieve the same level of understanding as the algorithm. We can only try to interpret its intentions with our limited knowledge, which inevitably leads to confusion.

This report attempts to analyze the Paxos algorithm from an extraterrestrial perspective. By establishing a simple graphical representation of the algorithm's rules, we aim to gain a clearer understanding of how it operates. This visualization helps us see the underlying structure and logic behind the algorithm.

## 1. The Trouble with God

Let's first examine the problems faced by the algorithm and its potential sources of trouble.

Assume that God wants a group of people to collectively perform the same task. The first issue the algorithm encounters is that everyone is unreliable. When assigning tasks to person A, there are two possibilities: either A is completely unaware of the task assignment (due to wandering off or being preoccupied), or A reacts very slowly and hesitantly, sometimes even refusing to perform the task midway through.

This problem seems somewhat manageable as long as not all individuals are unreliable. If a few reliable individuals exist within the group, they can guide the rest. The algorithm repeatedly selects a subset of reliable individuals to ensure that tasks are completed correctly.

---

## 2. The Nine Levels of Magic: Time Stand Still

The most challenging issue, however, is that many tasks occur in **parallel** (denoted as `||` in the algorithm). When person A is busy performing their task, it's not uncommon for person B to receive a new instruction. If B ignores this new instruction and continues with the old one, the entire system may collapse.

The algorithm addresses this issue by employing a **time stand still** mechanism (`Time Stand Still`). By freezing all activities at specific moments, the algorithm ensures that everyone is working on the latest version of their task. This requires precise coordination and synchronization between all participants.

---

## 2.1 The Nine Levels of Magic: Time Stand Still

As the almighty being, God can observe the entire system from a perspective far beyond the limitations of mortal beings. With perfect knowledge and infinite power, God can directly intervene in the system's operations. This divine ability allows God to freeze time at will, ensuring that all tasks are aligned before any new instructions are processed.

From a human standpoint, this capability seems almost impossible to achieve. However, by understanding the fundamental principles of modern physics, we can approximate this behavior using **time stand still** mechanisms. These mechanisms allow the system to pause and align its state before proceeding with updates.

---

### 2.1.1 The Basics of Time Stand Still

The concept of time stand still is rooted in modern physics, particularly in how clocks operate. By maintaining a consistent reference point (`Global Timestamp`), all participants can synchronize their actions. This ensures that any new instructions are processed after all previous tasks have been completed.

---

### 2.1.2 Steps in the Paxos Algorithm

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the Paxos algorithm:

1. **Proposer's Step**: The Proposer (denoted as `P`) generates a new proposal (`ProposalID`). This ID is unique and increases with each attempt.
   
   ```plaintext
   update MainRecord
   set version = version + 1
   where version = :record_version
   ```

2. **Acceptor's Step**: Each Acceptor (denoted as `A`) checks if the new proposal matches their current version (`Version`). If it does, they accept the proposal and update their own record.

3. **Consensus Achievement**: Once all Acceptors have accepted a proposal, the system reaches consensus, and time stand still no longer is necessary.

---

## 2.2 The Underlying Mechanism

The algorithm's success lies in its ability to synchronize all participants. By using a **global timestamp**, it ensures that updates are processed in the correct order. This prevents conflicting instructions from causing chaos within the system.

For example, in Kafka's distributed streaming system, multiple consumers can be part of the same topic. While each consumer processes data independently, the Paxos algorithm ensures that their actions remain aligned through a shared timestamp (`Global Timestamp`).

---

### 2.2.1 Example: Kafka and the Global Timestamp

In Kafka, consumers within the same consumer group may have different lag levels. To ensure consistency, the algorithm uses a global timestamp to track when each partition was last updated. This allows all consumers to fetch messages from the same point in time.

---

## 3. The Eight Levels of Magic: Divination by Numbers

The final challenge is to translate these abstract concepts into practical mechanisms. The algorithm's ability to handle distributed coordination without centralized control is what makes it so powerful. However, implementing this requires a deep understanding of both the algorithm and the underlying system.

---

### 3.1 The Role of Optimistic Concurrency Control

A key component of the algorithm is its use of **optimistic concurrency control** (`OCC`). This mechanism allows multiple users to work on the same data without locking mechanisms, as long as changes are versioned correctly.

For instance:

```plaintext
update MainRecord
set version = version + 1
where version = :record_version
```

This update operation increments the record's version number. If another user has updated the record since the last fetch, their version will differ, and the operation will fail unless it can be retried.

---

### 3.2 The Final Leap: From Theory to Implementation

Translating these ideas into actual code requires careful design and implementation. The algorithm's reliance on version numbers and global timestamps means that any system implementing it must have a robust way of tracking changes.

---

## Conclusion

From an extraterrestrial perspective, the Paxos algorithm appears as a simple set of rules. However, its ability to handle distributed coordination without centralized control makes it a true miracle of modern computing. While humans may never fully grasp its complexity, our attempts to implement and understand it bring us closer to achieving similar capabilities.

## 1. Introduction to Distributed Systems
Distributed systems are systems where the failure of one component does not affect the entire system. These systems rely on multiple nodes (nodes) working together to achieve a common goal.


- **Scalability**: The ability to expand or contract the system as needed.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The ability to continue functioning even when some components fail.
- **Distributed Coordination**: The ability for nodes to work together without a central coordinator.


The Paxos algorithm is used to achieve consensus in distributed systems. It works by dividing the system into phases and ensuring that all nodes agree on a single value.


- **Proposer**: The node responsible for generating a proposal.
- **Acceptor**: The node responsible for accepting or rejecting proposals.
- **Prepare Phase**: The phase where the proposer collects votes.
- **Commit Phase**: The phase where the accepted value is written to the log.


The Raft algorithm is another consensus algorithm that uses a leader election mechanism. Once a leader is elected, it is responsible for replicating its state across all other nodes.


- **Leader**: The node responsible for replicating its state.
- **Candidate**: A node that can become the leader if the current leader fails.
- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Ensures that the leader is always available to replicate its state.


The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection-oriented protocol used for data transmission over the internet. It ensures that data packets are delivered reliably by using acknowledgments and retransmissions.


- **Three-Way Handshake**: Establishes a connection between two nodes.
- **Acknowledge**: Confirms the receipt of data packets.
- **Retransmission**: Resends data if it is not received correctly.


The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol used for real-time applications like video streaming and online gaming. It does not guarantee data delivery but provides low latency.


- **No Connection**: Unlike TCP, UDP does not establish a connection before data transmission.
- **Best-Effort Delivery**: Attempts to deliver data as quickly as possible, but does not guarantee it.


In distributed systems, log replication is used to ensure that all nodes have the same state. This is achieved by replicating the log of one node to all other nodes.


- **Log Entry Generation**: The node generates a log entry.
- **Transmission**: The log entry is transmitted to other nodes.
- **Application of Log Entries**: Each node applies the log entries in the order they were received.


Consensus algorithms are used to ensure that all nodes agree on a single value. Two common consensus algorithms are Paxos and Raft.


- **Paxos**: Uses a leader election mechanism and ensures agreement through the Prepare and Commit phases.
- **Raft**: Also uses leader election but focuses on replicating the state of the leader node.


Failure detection is the process of identifying when a component has failed. In distributed systems, this is often done using heartbeat messages or other mechanisms.


- **Sender**: Sends periodic heartbeat messages.
- **Receiver**: Monitors for heartbeat messages to detect failures.


Recovery mechanisms are used to restore the system to a consistent state after a failure. This can be achieved through log replay or other recovery protocols.


- **Log Entry Extraction**: Extracts log entries from the failed node.
- **Application of Log Entries**: Applies the log entries to other nodes to restore consistency.



## Classic Problem: How to Prevent Brainiac from Taking Over

In algorithms that require leader election, a classic problem is **how to prevent the system from splitting into two separate clusters** (i.e., **preventing brainiac from taking over**). If the old leader has already been accepted by the majority of the cluster but refuses to step down, what can we do? A general solution is:

1. **Define the Old Leader as a Zombie**: Ignore all epoch values from the previous generation (e.g., reject any request where `epoch` is too small).
2. **Let the Old Leader Do Whatever It Wants**: We don't restrict its behavior in its own little world. However, it cannot rise above becoming just one of many zombies.
3. **Let the New Leader Take Over**: The new leader should **write its epoch value** (similar to writing a global shared variable) before processing any requests.

In this setup:
- The old leader will process requests but won't be able to influence the outcome because it can't see the new leader's epoch.
- The system will eventually elect a new leader that can communicate with all members of the cluster.


### Quantum Mechanics and Our Visible World

In our current understanding of physics, as quantum mechanics progresses, observing or measuring has taken on a whole new meaning. According to quantum field theory, we have a view (picture) of what's happening in an invisible time (quantum realm). In this strange world:
- Wild things (entities) are competing and annihilating each other.
- Ultimately, all we see in our visible world is the result of these quantum computations.

Through the weird phenomenon of quantum tunneling, we can actually observe phenomena that would otherwise be hidden from our classical understanding. This allows us to **peek behind the veil** of the overwhelming complexity of our everyday world.


### The "Cover and Conceal" Principle

The old saying "Plug your ears, close your eyes" is not just a silly joke. In our world, it's a principle that can actually work:
- If we can effectively create an information bubble (i.e., isolate all the information in a separate universe), we can manipulate what people know.
- This manipulation allows us to control their perception of reality.

Thus, understanding this principle is crucial for anyone trying to influence or control large-scale systems.



According to religious teachings:
- All beings are equal. There is no distinction between them.
- This equality implies symmetry (Symmetric), which is the foundation of harmony in society.

However, a society cannot survive on just one sound. Each individual must have their own opinion, and every opinion deserves respect. Why then does one opinion emerge victorious? It's not because of its inherent superiority but because of how it reflects the collective will.

Mathematically, this process is called **breaking symmetry** (Symmetry Broken). It represents a fundamental concept in distributed systems where agreement is reached through a series of proposals and acceptances.



When consensus is achieved:
- Who knows what the others have agreed on?
- A fascinating fact: At the exact moment consensus is reached, no individual participant knows that a consensus has been reached.

This seems contradictory. However, as time progresses:
- The system will reveal the truth through a series of steps.
- Each participant will learn about the agreed value (chosen value) in their own time.

![paxos\_consensus](paxos/paxos_consensus.png)



Consider a scenario with 5 acceptors and multiple proposers:
- At ProposalID = t1, proposal P1 is accepted by A1 and A2. No majority yet.
- At ProposalID = t2, proposal P2 is accepted by A3 and A4. No majority yet.
- At ProposalID = t3, proposal P3 is accepted by A2, A3, and A4. Now a majority!

This shows that even if the first two proposals fail to get majority acceptance, subsequent proposals can still lead to consensus.



From the previous example:
- Before consensus was reached, **acceptors could change their view** (e.g., A3 accepted P2 and then P3).
- Propoters might go offline, causing temporary communication issues.
- However, once a proposal is accepted by a majority, it becomes the chosen value.

This means that consensus is a dynamic process. New information can continuously update our understanding of what has been agreed.



If we allow for the possibility of consensus being overturned:
- Suppose at ProposalID = t3, P3 was accepted by A2, A3, and A4.
- Now, at ProposalID = t4, can a new proposal P4 be accepted, overwriting the previous consensus?
- From a logical standpoint: Yes. If the system allows for dynamic updates to the agreed value, then yes.

However, from a practical perspective:
- Once a value is established as the chosen value, changing it requires a lot of trust in the system's ability to handle dynamic changes.
- This is where the concept of **consensus dynamics** comes into play.

![paxos\_consensus\_fail](paxos/paxos_consensus_fail.png)



Now, let's consider the case when A3 crashes during processing of P3:
1. If A3 has already accepted P3: No problem.
2. If A3 hasn't yet accepted P3: Then A3 is in a state where it can no longer influence the outcome.

This means that:
- If A3 was about to accept P3, but the system crashes before it does so, then the cluster will not have reached consensus on P3.
- This creates a situation where some participants are partially committed but unable to complete their action.


The following document provides a technical explanation of the Paxos algorithm, including its key concepts and implementation details.


### 1. Introduction to Paxos Algorithm

The Paxos algorithm is a method for achieving consensus in a distributed system. It relies on the concept of **quorum** (a group of nodes that must all agree on a value) and **proposal IDs** (unique identifiers for each proposal). The algorithm ensures that if a majority of nodes agree on a value, it will be accepted as the correct value.


## 1.1 Key Components

- **Proposer**: A node responsible for generating and submitting proposals.
- **Acceptor**: A node that votes on whether to accept or reject a proposal.
- **Proposal ID**: A unique identifier assigned to each proposal.
- **Quorum**: A set of nodes that must all agree on a value.



The algorithm proceeds in two phases:

1. **Phase 1: Proposal Generation**
   - The Proposer generates a new proposal with a unique Proposal ID.
   - The Proposer sends this proposal to all Acceptors.

2. **Phase 2: Value Assignment**
   - Each Acceptor votes on the proposal based on their local state.
   - If a majority of Acceptors agree, the value is committed; otherwise, it is rejected.



In the following example:

- Node A3 (A3) is responsible for generating proposals.
- Nodes A1, A2, and A4 are Acceptors.
- Proposal ID "P3" is assigned to a new proposal.


A3 submits Proposal P3 to all Acceptors:
```
ProposalID = "P3"
Value = current_value_of_A3
```


Each Acceptor votes on the proposal:

- A1 votes `accept` because its local value matches.
- A2 votes `reject` because its local value differs.
- A4 votes `accept` because its local value matches.

Since two out of three Acceptors agree, the proposal is accepted. The value associated with Proposal P3 becomes the new consensus value.

---



In an ideal system where all nodes agree on a single value (i.e., the system exhibits **monotonicity**), the following behavior is observed:

1. Once a value is committed, it will never change.
2. All future proposals will reflect this committed value.



Consider the following scenario:

- The system has reached a consensus on value `V`.
- A new proposal is submitted with value `V'` (where \( V' \neq V \)).

If the system exhibits monotonicity, all Acceptors will reject this new proposal. This ensures that the system remains in a consistent state and avoids oscillations between conflicting values.

---



In reality, distributed systems often face uncertainty due to network delays, failures, or inconsistent local states. The Paxos algorithm addresses these challenges by:

1. Allowing for a **graceful degradation** when consensus cannot be reached.
2. Enabling the system to recover from conflicts and reach subsequent agreements.



Suppose two nodes (A3 and A4) are attempting to agree on a value:

- A3 has value `V1`.
- A4 has value `V2`.

If no quorum can be formed, the system will not commit any value. However, if additional nodes join the system and reach agreement on a new value \( V \), the system can continue operating normally.

---



The **maximum proposer rule** is a key optimization in the Paxos algorithm. It states that:

1. If a Proposer has submitted more proposals than any other node, its latest proposal will always be accepted (provided it has majority support).
2. This prevents multiple Propoters from dominating the system and ensures efficient agreement.



In this scenario:

- A3 is the current maximum proposer with Proposal ID "P5".
- A1, A2, and A4 are Acceptors.
- A3 submits Proposal P5 with value `V_new`.

If at least two other nodes accept this proposal, it will be committed as the new consensus value. This ensures that the system progresses toward agreement.

---



When implementing the Paxos algorithm, consider the following:

1. **Network Latency**: Ensure that all Acceptors receive proposals within a reasonable time.
2. **Failure Handling**: Implement mechanisms to handle node failures and ensure quorum formation.
3. **Security**: Protect against malicious nodes attempting to disrupt the consensus process.



If an Acceptor fails just before voting on a proposal:

- The Proposer resends the proposal to all other Acceptors.
- If a new quorum can be formed, the value is committed; otherwise, it remains in limbo.

---



Achieving consensus in distributed systems is challenging due to:

1. **Network Uncertainty**: Nodes may have conflicting views of the system's state.
2. **Time Constraints**: Proposals must be processed within a limited timeframe.
3. **Adversarial Behavior**: Some nodes may attempt to disrupt the consensus process.



If an adversary submits conflicting proposals, the system must:

- Detect the conflict.
- Resolve it by selecting a proposal that has majority support.
- Minimize the impact on system performance.

---



Consider a grid of nodes where each node's state is determined by its position in the grid. The quorum formation process involves:

1. Identifying a set of nodes that can reach agreement.
2. Using their collective state to determine the final value.

![paxos\_grid\_quorum](paxos/paxos_grid_quorum.png)

---



The Paxos algorithm provides a robust method for achieving consensus in distributed systems. By leveraging quorums and proposal IDs, it ensures that the system can reliably reach agreement on values even in uncertain environments.

## 1. Introduction to Quorum-Based Consensus

In this section, we will explore the concept of **Quorum**-based consensus, which forms the foundation of many distributed systems. A **Quorum** is a set of nodes in a distributed system that can reach agreement on a specific value or decision.


## Key Components of a Quorum
1. **Size**: The number of nodes required to form a Quorum.
2. **Consistency**: All nodes in the Quorum must agree on the same value.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: The Quorum should be able to function even if some nodes fail.

For the example provided, we have `3*6` Acceptors forming a Grid. We can define a Quorum as any single column of the Grid. It is clear that any two columns are disjoint. To avoid making conflicting decisions, we need to build a bridge between these columns and define the **Paxos first phase**.

---



1. **Reading Phase**: During this phase, at least one row must be read from the Quorum.
2. **Agreement**: If a value is already established in the system, it will not change during this phase.

In the example provided:
- Any row and any column are disjoint.
- Once a value is read from the system, it remains consistent.
- The total number of nodes involved is `3 + 6 - 1 = 8`.

Thus, reading and writing to the Quorum ensures that the new value will not conflict with existing values.

---



To achieve consensus in a distributed system:
1. **Overcome Individual Limitations**: Transform an individual into a member of a group.
2. **Belonging to Multiple Quorums**: An individual can belong to multiple Quorums.
3. **Coordination Between Quorums**: Ensure that all past and future Quorums are coordinated.

---



For humans, time is a mysterious pre-existing entity. Our coordination work seems to rely heavily on time's arrow.


- Isaac Newton first discovered the law of cause and effect.
- According to his view:
  - Time's left side causes effects on its right side.
  - This led to the famous equation:  
    ```plaintext
    F = m\* a, \* cause = m\* a, \* effect
    ```
  - The right side is the effect.


- Albert Einstein questioned Newton's view through his thought experiments.
- He proposed that time is not unique:
  - **Time lines are not unique**.
  - How do we avoid losing direction in such a system?

---



To address these questions, distributed systems often use **Vector Clocks**:
1. **Remember all time lines**: Maintain a record of all known time lines.
2. **Total ordering**: Create a total order that respects all time lines.

By aligning all time lines into a single clock, we can avoid conflicts and implement the **Paxos algorithm**.

---



1. **Time is not unique**: This creates ambiguity in distributed systems.
2. **Avoid direction loss**: Use Vector Clocks to maintain consistency.

The **Vector Clock** provides a way to:
- **Remember all time lines**: By keeping track of multiple timestamps.
- **Maintain total order**: By combining all known time lines into one.

This ensures that the system can still form a Quorum and achieve consensus even when time is not unique.

Finally, let us listen once more to the divine intention:

* Divine says: There must be time.
* Divine says: Time should stand still.
* Divine says: The world is vast.
* Divine says: Infinity in flesh.
* Divine says: Fire passes through.
* Divine says: The world is connected.

---



In conclusion, the **Paxos algorithm** and **Vector Clocks** are powerful tools for achieving consensus in distributed systems. By understanding and addressing the complexities of time, we can build systems that are both efficient and reliable.
