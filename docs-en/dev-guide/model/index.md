# Excel Model

## [Excel Data Model](excel-model.md)

## [Read/Write Excel Model](excel-xlsx.md)

Save Excel as HTML, save the domain model object to XLSX format, etc.

## [API Model](api-model.md)

## [Custom Excel Model](custom-model.md)

In addition to using the built-in data models, API models, etc., in the platform, we can also create our own domain models. We only need to write `import` statements for the model files and register them with the Nop platform. This way, we can define domain objects through Excel files.
