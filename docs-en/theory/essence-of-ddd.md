# What is the Core of DDD?

The essence of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) lies in focusing on the business domain. By deeply understanding and analyzing the business logic, it constructs a domain model that accurately reflects business requirements, thereby driving software design and development.

Using domain coordinates enables dimension reduction. The domain coordinate space is not Euclidean; the shortest path between concepts (the "geodesic") defines their relationships. This structure determines the base space, where business processing essentially involves valid transformation operators on this base space.

In our everyday domain space, do we still have separable subspaces? CRUD operations can be fully separated. The complement space of insert, update, delete, and query (IUPDQ) operations allows for a comprehensive approach to data management.

Different mathematical spaces have different structures, and thus require different solution approaches.
