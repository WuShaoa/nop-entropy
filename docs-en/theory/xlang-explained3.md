# About the Third Round of Q&A on XLang Language

## 1. Is XLang a framework or a programming language?

XLang is not a traditional programming language, but if you ask DeepSeek, they will explain:

> XLang combines the high level of abstraction characteristic of Fourth-generation languages (4GL) and the theoretical innovation of Fifth-generation languages (5GL). Its core positioning is "a meta-language for reversible computation," which enhances efficiency through domain-specific syntax while redefining the lower-level rules of program construction using structural space theory and differential computing. Therefore, XLang can be viewed as a progression within Fourth-generation languages or referred to as a "Fourth-generation+ language" that achieves a unique balance between low-code and theoretical innovation.

Mainstream programming languages are referred to as Third-generation languages (3GL). They typically use a `main` function as the entry point. The overall purpose of these languages is to write executable functions, and the compiler's role is to translate the program logic into hardware-executable instructions. However, Fourth-generation languages (4GL) shift focus to descriptive capabilities through highly abstract declarative syntax and graphical programming tools. In essence, 4GL emphasizes "non-procedural" approaches, moving away from hardware-level adaptation toward higher levels of abstraction.

The development of LLVM has made hardware-level optimization an independent issue, allowing different programming languages to share a common compilation back-end. This does not define the core requirements of a programming language. We expect `Moonbit`, this newly emerging programming language, to provide a compact and lightweight toolchain. By translating XScript's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) into `Moonbit`'s AST, subsequent processes will handle it automatically.

XLang includes a sub-language called XScript. Its syntax intentionally selects a subset of JavaScript syntax with limited extensions, while its type system mirrors that of Java in simplified form. This ensures lossless translation from the AST layer to all mainstream programming languages.

While the Nop platform is built on the XLang language and establishes a comprehensive low-code platform, this does not imply that XLang itself is a framework. Currently, XLang runs on the JVM, relying on some libraries and implementations provided by Java's ecosystem, but this does not mean it depends on Java as a whole. The entire functionality of XLang can be ported to other programming languages like `Lisp` or `Rust`. When writing business code, you can use only the XLang language without interacting with Java's lower-level components.

## 2. Can a Turing machine implement Turing completeness?

The root reason for Turing completeness in a Turing machine lies in its ability to simulate all other automata. A Turing machine is defined as a theoretical model of computation that can be configured to recognize any computable language, and it serves as the foundation for understanding computational complexity.

Regarding this statement, some programming enthusiasts might object: "Turing completeness is defined by the Turing machine, so 'the Turing machine is Turing complete' is a definition-based truth." My perspective is that while one may get stuck on the mathematical definitions, the historical context often drives such terminology. The term "Turing complete" is more about recognition of any computable function rather than strict adherence to formal definitions.

In terms of concepts:

- **Turing completeness** and **NP completeness** are analogous in the sense that both describe the computational power of a system. A Turing machine can compute all functions that are considered computable, while NP-completeness refers to a class of problems that are computationally intensive but still solvable within polynomial time. However, not all NP-complete problems are Turing complete.

- **Lambda calculus**, which underpins functional programming, is another foundational model of computation, with its own form of completeness. Lambda expressions can be used to define functions and are considered Turing complete in the theoretical sense.

In practical terms, the distinction between these models often revolves around their specific computational properties rather than abstract definitions. While a Turing machine's definition inherently implies its Turing completeness, the applicability of this concept depends on the context of computation.

## 3. Is XLang aiming to replace Java?

XLang is not intended to replace `C++` or `Java`, which are mainstream programming languages. In fact, they should be viewed as complementary.

```xml
<c:script lang="groovy">
  Here you can use Groovy syntax
</c:script>
```

XLang uses XML syntax for its sub-languages like XScript and Xpl (a template language). The `<c:script>` tag allows embedding XScript scripts into the system. If `lang="groovy"` is specified, it uses Groovy syntax for scripting.

The existing programming languages have solved many of the problems that XLang addresses in their own ways. While low-code platforms like Nop leverage XLang's descriptive capabilities, this does not mean that XLang itself is a framework or that its core purpose is to replace traditional programming languages.

In summary:

- **Fourth-generation languages (4GL)** focus on reducing procedural coding through high-level abstractions.
- **XLang** builds upon these concepts while introducing new theoretical frameworks for program construction.
- **Traditional programming languages** like `Java` and `C++` remain essential for performance-critical applications.

Thus, XLang is positioned to complement rather than replace existing programming paradigms, offering a unique approach that bridges low-code convenience with high-level abstraction.



## 1. Understanding XLang

XLang is designed to address certain aspects of programming that existing languages struggle with. By introducing **differential concepts** and **reversible concepts**, XLang can handle problems that require both `F(X) + Delta` computations efficiently.

While XLang addresses unique problem domains, it does not confine itself to domain-specific languages (DSLs). Instead, its syntax and semantics remain general-purpose, making it suitable for collaboration with any third-generation programming language. For example, XScript can be replaced by any other third-generation language.


## 2. Technical Foundation

Just as TypeScript extends JavaScript with `TypeScript = JavaScript + TypeSystem + JSX`, XLang builds upon JavaScript with:

```
XLang = JavaScript + Xpl + MetaProgramming + DeltaProgramming
```

Here, **Xpl** is an XML-based template language similar to JSX.

The unique aspects of XLang are:
- **DeltaProgramming**: Handling differences between versions.
- **MetaProgramming**: Customizing code generation based on context.

XLang does not rely heavily on JavaScript syntax. Instead, it allows the use of any third-generation programming language for its `XScript` component.



A common misunderstanding about XLang is that it uses XML syntax, making it incompatible with standard programming languages. However, this isn't the case. Like TypeScript embeds JSX within JavaScript, XLang embeds XML-like structures (`<...>`) directly into JavaScript without altering its core syntax.

Is `XLang = JavaScript + XML` equivalent to `TypeScript = JavaScript + TypeSystem + JSX`? Not exactly. While both extend JavaScript, XLang does so with a focus on XML-based abstractions and reversibility, whereas TypeScript focuses on type safety.



Can XLang establish its own ecosystem?

Yes, but it's not unique in this regard. Every new language seems to require common utilities like JSON parsers or HTTP clients. Instead of reinventing these tools for each language, XLang leverages existing ecosystems by integrating with popular languages such as Java.

XLang's ecosystem includes:
- **Common utilities**: JSON parsers, HTTP clients, etc.
- **Host languages**: Java, JavaScript, etc.
- **Custom generators**: Tools like `xpl2js` or `metaprogramming frameworks`.

The future of XLang lies in enabling code reuse across multiple programming paradigms. For example:
```
Future: F(X) + G(X) + Delta
```
could be implemented using a combination of WebAssembly and GraalVM's polyglot capabilities.



Can we visualize how XLang works?

Yes, through tools like `xlang-visualizer` or custom diagrams that illustrate:
- **Reversible operations**: How changes propagate.
- **Differential computations**: How deltas are applied.
- **Meta abstractions**: Higher-level constructs.

For a concrete example, refer to the article [From Reversible Computation to Kustomize](https://example.com/reversible-kustomize).



For instance:
```
<Delta: type="binary" src="FileA.xml" dest="FileB.xml"/>
```
This XLang snippet defines a binary delta between two XML files, ensuring efficient updates.

In general, we do not directly use XLang for business application development. Instead, we first define a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) using XLang and then develop specific business logic using this DSL. XLang defines the structure of the DSL through its XDef meta-model, while the Nop platform's `nop-xdefs` module collects all predefined DSL meta-model files.

When developing your own DSL, you do not need to start from scratch. You can directly combine existing XDef meta-model definitions. For example, in a rule model, you can reuse variables defined in `var-define.xdef` using the `xdef:ref` attribute.


## Example Rule Definition

```xml
<rule>
  <input name="!var-name" xdef:ref="schema/var-define.xdef" xdef:name="RuleInputDefineModel"
         computed="!boolean=false" mandatory="!boolean=false" xdef:unique-attr="name"/>
  ...
</rule>
```



XLang's merging algorithm is straightforward, similar to React and Vue's virtual DOM diff algorithm but even simpler. Due to its design, any list in XLang must have a unique identifier (e.g., `id` or `name`). This ensures stable `xpath` references for consistent updates.



XLang extends standard XML with a few special annotations like `x:schema`, `x:extends`, and `x:override`. The underlying language engine understands these annotations and applies the corresponding transformations. The `x:schema` annotation references an XDef meta-model, which defines the structure of the XML nodes and attributes.



```xml
<task x:schema="/nop/schema/task.xdef">
  <steps xdef:body-type="list" xdef:key-attr="name">
    <xpl name="!string">
      <source xdef:value="xpl"/>
      <logInfo("hello world")/>
    </xpl>
  </steps>
</task>
```



The meta-model defined in `task.xdef` specifies that a `<task>` element contains multiple `<steps>`, each with a unique name. Each `<step>` can have an `<xpl>` child, which represents the template to be evaluated.

The structure of `task.xdef` is similar to `task.xml`. The root `<task>` element's `x:schema` points to `task.xdef`, defining its structure and constraints.



```xml
<task x:schema="/nop/schema/task.xdef">
  <steps>
    <xpl name="test">
      <source>
        logInfo("hello world");
      </source>
    </xpl>
  </steps>
</task>
```



1. **Meta-Model Definition**: The `task.xdef` meta-model defines the structure of `<task>` elements in XML format.
2. **Consistency**: Both `task.xdef` and `task.xml` use the same structure, ensuring compatibility between meta-model and actual usage.
3. **Reusability**: Custom extensions can be added to `task.xdef`, allowing for flexible configurations without altering existing XML files.



A friend once explained it like this:

"I finally get how XLang handles differences! It's like a set of rules that define what changes when something is updated. XLang uses these rules to merge changes efficiently, whether they're in XML, YAML, or any other format. The difference is applied using the defined templates, making it easy to manage and extend."

XLang defines how DSLs are built and how differences between versions are handled. Once a DSL is defined, the actual implementation can be extended without changing the meta-model, allowing for flexible and scalable solutions.


XLang leverages the power of meta modeling by defining a domain-specific language (DSL) through its `xdef` meta model. This DSL, referred to as XDSL, maps business operations into a structured coordinate system defined by XDSL. Each point within this system can define a delta difference.

In this system, large quantities of coordinates can be processed to derive Delta differences. These deltas are identified and managed conceptually, representing an integrated change pattern as a distinct cognitive entity.



XLang serves as a meta language that operates indirectly through the definition of a DSL. Instead of directly expressing deltas, it first defines a specific DSL and then models language-level deltas within this DSL. From an abstract perspective, every sub-language within XLang is defined by the `xdef` meta model itself.

This recursive definition means that even the `xdef` meta model is defined by itself. Consequently, all aspects of language-level delta modeling are inherently encapsulated within this self-referential system.



Many find it difficult to grasp the meta properties because they fail to recognize the inherent nature of these meta constructs. It’s not about directly solving problems with A (a specific tool or framework) but navigating through a logical hierarchy on a higher meta level. Solutions are projected down into lower levels where specific implementations take shape.

The essence lies in understanding that complex systems are built upon layers of abstraction, each defined by its own meta model. Only by mastering these meta properties can one effectively design and implement the underlying structures that support such systems.
