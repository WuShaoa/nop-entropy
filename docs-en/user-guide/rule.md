The decision table and decision tree are essential components in the system for defining conditional logic. The decision table is used to map inputs to predefined outcomes, while the decision tree provides a more structured and hierarchical approach to making decisions based on the given rules.


The object validation model ensures that data adheres to specific constraints before it can be processed or stored. This model uses validation rules defined in the rule system to check the integrity of the data being entered or modified.
