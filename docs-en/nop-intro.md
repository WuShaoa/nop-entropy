The **Nop Platform 2.0** is a next-generation low-code development platform built from scratch based on reversible computing theory. It surpasses traditional component-based and model-driven architectures in terms of granularity, offering an effective solution to coarse-grained software reuse challenges. It addresses the limitations of traditional low-code platforms, such as poor scalability, performance issues, and restricted applicability to a limited number of mature domains.

The **Nop Platform** adopts the **Language-Oriented Programming (LOFP)** paradigm. Instead of directly using general-purpose programming languages like Java or C# for application development, it first defines a domain-specific language (DSL) tailored to the specific business requirements and then leverages this DSL to express the business logic. The design goal of the Nop Platform is to become a user-friendly **Domain Language Workbench**. By introducing simple metadata definitions, it can automatically generate corresponding DSL parsers, validators, IDE plugins, and debuggers, while also enriching the DSL with module decomposition, customization capabilities, and generative programming features. In this aspect, it resembles JetBrains' MPS product but differs fundamentally in its design principles and implementation strategy.

Traditional component-based technologies are limited to reusing the common parts between two components, resulting in a reuse granularity that is smaller than either of the components themselves. This makes it theoretically impossible to achieve the reuse of complex, integrated systems. Reversible computing theory, however, emphasizes the importance of the inverse concept (invariants) in software construction and provides a systematic approach to coarse-grained reuse through its focus on delta computation.

Reversible computing extends the fundamental principles of software construction beyond traditional component-based approaches by introducing a systematized method for handling deltas. It introduces a new software construction principle that can be implemented using generative programming tools, enabling coarse-grained reuse where it was previously deemed impossible. This approach aligns with modern practices like Docker and K8s' kustomize feature, which utilize delta-based customization to streamline configuration management.

The **Nop Platform** is a concrete implementation of reversible computing theory. It consists of two main parts:

1. **nop-entropy**: The backend component implemented in Java, independent of third-party frameworks, and compatible with Quarkus, Spring, or Solon for integration.
2. **GraalVM Support**: The platform leverages GraalVM technology to compile applications into native executables, eliminating the need for JDK installation and significantly improving startup times by factors of 10-100.

The **nop-entropy** component employs a cloud-native design with built-in support for distributed transactions and multi-tenant scenarios. It can run either as a single instance or as part of a distributed cluster. The platform provides comprehensive API services and transforms individual business object services into batch processing tasks, supporting a wide range of business scenarios with minimal configuration.

During the development phase, **nop-entropy** functions as an incremental development platform that automatically generates various types of code and documentation. In production, it acts as a user-friendly no-code platform, enabling end-users to modify business logic through a drag-and-drop interface. This approach minimizes manual coding, reduces dependency on developers, and enables continuous iteration based on what the user sees.

The **Nop Platform** provides full support for DSL development, including XDef meta-modeling and XDSL domain-specific language integration. It seamlessly incorporates AI models, allowing for rapid integration of state-of-the-art AI capabilities into custom-built DSLs.

The **nop-entropy** component itself is built using Nop Platform-generated code, with approximately half of its functionality automatically generated. This approach significantly reduces manual coding efforts and leverages internal meta-modeling and delta computation capabilities for efficient updates and enhancements.

All components of the **Nop Platform** are open-source, with no commercial versions planned. The released parts include implementations of various DSLs (e.g., XLang), ORM, IoC containers, distributed configuration, GraphQL engines, report generators, job schedulers, batch processing engines, and rule engines. Future plans include adding workflow engines, BI tools, and other common development components.

The Nop Platform represents more than just a reimplementation of existing open-source tools; it is built from scratch according to reversible computing principles, ensuring that it addresses the limitations of current solutions while offering innovative new capabilities.

> X = A + B + C
> 
> Y = A + B + D = X + (-C + D) = X + Delta


For a system X that satisfies the reversible computing principle, in the absence of decomposing X, we can always supplement additional delta information to convert it into any target Y. Therefore, without modifying the source code of the Nop platform, we can implement customized modifications for all platform functionalities by supplementing delta descriptions, such as customizing database table structures, business logic, and visualization designers. All business products developed on the Nop platform inherit this delta customization capability, significantly reducing the complexity of custom software development for large-scale business applications.


## Nop's Advantages

The Nop platform provides a new technical architecture support for AI-era smart manufacturing, being the only open-source platform that theoretically resolves the coarse-grained software reuse issue. It enables deep secondary development for core banking applications across different clients without modifying the underlying product source code.

Nop also introduces innovative ideas for implementing lower-level frameworks and engines. Traditionally, each engine (e.g., Hibernate ORM and Flowable workflow engine) is designed and implemented separately, sharing only a small amount of common code through the commons package. The Nop platform treats each engine as a model, clearly defining its structure through a metamodel and storing it in a text file as a domain-specific language (DSL). Using the Nop platform's underlying infrastructure, all engines can share its metamodel and meta-programming capabilities. By designing a custom runtime executor tailored to each engine's specific requirements, we no longer need to worry about expandability, flexibility, or model visualization design. This results in lightweight implementations for individual engines, which typically consist of only a few thousand lines of code compared to open-source frameworks with tens of thousands of lines.

The goal of the Nop platform is not to become a ready-to-use, user-friendly development framework with polished details. Instead, it aims to explore the next-generation software construction principle and provide the best architectural practices for future-oriented software development.


## The Methodology Behind Reversible Computing

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have maintained a deep skepticism toward many software development principles and methodologies. Why do these principles exist? Can we scientifically prove their effectiveness from a theoretical perspective? For example, we always advocate for high internal cohesion, low coupling, and separation of concerns. But what exactly constitutes high or low internal cohesion, and to what extent should we enforce separation of concerns? During my graduate studies, I began developing my own software framework, attempting to integrate physical and mathematical concepts into the software architecture field around 2007. This led me to propose the reversible computing theory, which was later validated through subsequent software development efforts.

Large-scale software products generally follow a developmental trajectory from order to chaos. In physics, this corresponds to the second law of thermodynamics, or the entropy increase principle: entropy measures a system's disorder; all natural developments inevitably drive the system toward maximum disorder, with entropy never decreasing. If a process is reversible, entropy remains unchanged; if it is irreversible, entropy increases.

The core concept of reversible computing lies in reversibility. Reversibility is not merely about facilitating software component reuse; more fundamentally, it reflects the inherent operational rules of our universe. By adhering to the reversible computing principle, we can effectively manage the entropy growth during the software evolution process. Ideally, if a system could be made completely reversible, its entropy would remain constant.

In reality, entropy increase is an unavoidable fate. However, even though we cannot eliminate entropy growth entirely, we can choose to concentrate it in a manageable delta (delta). This allows us to protect the core architecture from corruption when delivering the system to new clients. By not carrying forward a client's personalized requirements, we can always start anew from a low-entropy state.

[Reversible Computing Theory](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/64004026) attempts to provide a more robust theoretical foundation for software construction. It explicitly elevates "delta" (delta) to the status of a primary concept, treating the total quantity (quantity = unit + delta) as a special case of delta. The theory revolves around reconstructing the delta concept and establishing a comprehensive conceptual framework. Reversible computing views software as an evolving abstract entity within a complex hierarchy, with its evolution process governed by distinct operational rules. It focuses on how minor deltas propagate and interact within the system to maintain order.
