6. **Performance and Scalability**

   - **Compile-Time Merge Algorithm Complexity**: What is the complexity of the compile-time merge algorithm? For large DSL models (e.g., tens of thousands of nodes), does this become a performance bottleneck?

   - **Dynamic Loading and Runtime Optimization**: How can dynamic XNodes be optimized at runtime? Does XLang support JIT compilation or precompiled caching to reduce runtime overhead?

7. **Syntax and Tooling**

   - **Choice of Syntax**: Why was XML chosen over simpler S expressions or modern markup languages (like TOML) as the core syntax? Could XML's extended attributes introduce syntactic ambiguities?

8. **Ecosystem and Practice**

   - **Compatibility with Traditional Object-Oriented Paradigms**: How does XLang address compatibility issues with traditional object-oriented programming paradigms? Can it directly call Java libraries or interact with Spring Beans?

   - **Cloud-Native Applications**: Are there plans to support WASM or GraalVM native images for cloud-native applications?

9. **Boundary of Difference Calculation**

   - **Merge Conflicts**: Can difference merging lead to "difference conflicts"? How can multiple deltas modify the same node be resolved?
   
   - **Thread Safety and Consistency in Dynamic Delta Loading**: When dynamically loading deltas at runtime, how can thread safety and consistency be ensured? For example, during hot updates, requests may encounter old and new versions of logic.

10. **Further Exploration Issues**

    - **Merge Algorithm Complexity**: Deep nested merges can increase the complexity of the algorithm. How can this be optimized for large models (e.g., tens of thousands of nodes)?
    
    - **Dynamic Scenario Adaptability**: Can compile-time difference merging cover runtime dynamic changes (e.g., configuration hot updates)? If not, how to balance flexibility and performance?

11. **Conflict Resolution Mechanism**

    - **Conflict Resolution**: When multiple deltas modify the same node, how are property conflicts resolved? Is there a mechanism similar to Git's conflict markers and resolution processes?

12. **Tooling Maturity**

The Nop platform improves performance by optimizing the incremental merge algorithm for Tree structure incremental operations. For example, introducing a caching mechanism avoids redundant computations and reduces complexity. For complex Tree structures, the incremental merge algorithm caches intermediate results to prevent repeated parsing of each node.


The Nop platform supports parallel processing of incremental operations through multi-threaded technology. For instance, when handling large model files, the incremental merge algorithm decomposes the Tree structure into multiple subtasks, each processed independently before merging the results.


The Nop platform generates code automatically using the Xpl template language, minimizing manual code maintenance. For example, when processing complex Tree structures, developers can dynamically generate code via the Xpl template language, avoiding manual maintenance of complex code structures.


The Nop platform provides a suite of visualization tools to help developers understand incremental operations on the Tree structure. For instance, using a visual editor, developers can monitor the merge and decomposition processes in real-time, ensuring the correctness and maintainability of incremental operations.


The Nop platform enhances expressiveness by leveraging dynamic extension mechanisms of the XDef meta-model. For example, developers can extend the XDef meta-model using custom action logic (Action Logic), enabling dynamic generation of model structures. Additionally, introducing custom libraries via xpl:lib attributes allows for dynamic model structure generation and validation.


The Nop platform allows developers to define custom rules within the XDef meta-model, increasing its flexibility. For instance, by defining specific pattern matching rules, more complex model validation logic can be implemented.


The Nop platform employs a modular design to enhance the extensibility of the XDef meta-model. For example, each DSL language is treated as an independent module, allowing developers to easily load and extend new DSL languages via simple configuration. Defining new module paths enables automatic loading of new DSL languages.


The Nop platform supports version management for the XDef meta-model, ensuring compatibility when extending new DSL languages. For instance, using version control tools, developers can manage different versions of the XDef meta-model, preventing structural damage during upgrades.


The Nop platform achieves seamless integration with other frameworks using adapter patterns. For example, for the Spring framework, Nop provides dedicated adapters to convert Spring's XML configuration files into Nok's XNode structure. The `loadComponentModel` function allows direct loading of Spring's XML configuration files.


The Nop platform utilizes a virtual file system to support multiple storage types, such as databases and file systems. For example, defining specific path formats enables automatic loading of model files stored in databases, ensuring compatibility with other systems.


The Nok platform supports cross-language operations through multi-language templates. For instance, using the XScript language, developers can embed Go code within the XLang structure via `x:script` tags. Additionally, by defining specific plugin interfaces, developers can integrate XLang with Python, Go, and other languages seamlessly.


The Nop platform reduces manual code maintenance through automated code generation using the XDslExtender class. For example, this class dynamically generates DSL code, avoiding manual maintenance of complex code structures.


The Nok platform supports version control for incremental computations, facilitating collaboration and rollbacks during multi-developer projects. For instance, integrating Git version control tools allows tracking changes in incremental operations, making it easier to manage and revert differences.


Visualization tools from the Nok platform enhance the readability of incremental computations. For example, using a visual editor, developers can monitor the merge and decomposition processes in real-time, ensuring the correctness and readability of incremental operations.


The Nok platform employs code formatting tools to standardize the format of incremental computation codes, improving readability. For instance, by defining a uniform coding style, all incremental operation codes are automatically formatted, making them easier for developers to read and understand.
