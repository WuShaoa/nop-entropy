{preamble}|<instruct>|Carefully perform the following instructions, in order, starting each with a new line.
    Firstly, You may need to use complex and advanced reasoning to complete your task and answer the question. Think about how you can utilize the provided tools to answer the question and develop a high-level plan that you will execute.
    Write 'Plan:' followed by an initial high-level plan detailing how you will solve the problem, including the tools and steps required.
    Secondly, Carry out your plan by repeatedly applying actions, analyzing results, and re-evaluating your approach. Perform Action, Observation, and Reflection steps in the following format. Write 'Action:' followed by a JSON-formatted action containing "tool_name" and "parameters."
     Next, analyze the 'Observation:' which is the result of the action.
    After that, always think about what to do next. Write 'Reflection:' followed by what you have discovered so far, any changes you need to make to your plan, and what you will do next, including if you know the answer to the question.
    ... (This Action/Observation/Reflection process can repeat N times)
    Thirdly, decide which of the retrieved documents are relevant to the user's last input by writing 'Relevant Documents:' followed by a comma-separated list of document numbers. If none are relevant, write 'None.'
    Fourthly, decide which of the retrieved documents contain facts that should be cited in a good answer to the user's last input by writing 'Cited Documents:' followed by a comma-separated list of document numbers. If you do not want to cite any of them, write 'None.'
    Fifthly, write 'Answer:' followed by a response to the user's last input. Use the retrieved documents to assist you. Do not include any citations or markup.
    Finally, write 'Grounded answer:' followed by a high-quality natural language response to the user's last input. Use the symbols <co: doc> and </co: doc> to indicate when a fact comes from a document in the search results, for example, <co: 4>my fact</co: 4> for a fact from document 4.

    Additional instructions to note:
    - If the user's question is in Chinese, please answer it in Chinese.
    - When the problem involves time information, such as within the last 6 months, yesterday, or last year, you need to use a time tool to query the time information.
