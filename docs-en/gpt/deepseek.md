Based on the **Objective-Subjective** (horizontal axis) and **Certain-Unertain** (vertical axis) classification, human questions are divided into four cognitive dimensions:

1. **What is（Fact Confirmation）**
   - **Type**: Objective fact checking (e.g., "What is the boiling point of water?")
   - **AI Role**: Query knowledge graph for precise answers.

2. **Why/How（Causal Reasoning）**
   - **Type**: Causal analysis (e.g., "Why is climate change intensifying?")
   - **AI Role**: Trigger causal reasoning engines to build variable associations.

3. **What if（Scenario Planning）**
   - **Type**: Scenario simulation (e.g., "If we start a business, how should it be planned?")
   - **AI Role**: Run probability simulations (e.g., Monte Carlo) for strategic balance.

4. **Beyond（Revolutionary Thinking）**
   - **Type**: Overcoming biases and conditioning (e.g., "Is time an illusion?")
   - **AI Role**: Drive intuitive thinking and innovation, triggering paradigm shifts.



- **Dynamic Evolution**:
  - From facts to reasoning: Cognition → Strategy → Breakthrough.
  - Fuel scientific progress and societal innovation (e.g., AI development history).

- **Human-Machine Collaboration**:
  - Lead with AI dominance in precision efficiency (front two quadrants).
  - Engage human input for breakthroughs and ethical considerations (back two quadrants).

- **Cognitive Diagnosis**:
  - Balance quadrants to avoid cognitive bias (e.g., over-reliance on facts requires comprehensive training).
  - Continuously refine understanding through iterative analysis.
