  ## Three-Sentence Explanation of What Reversible Computing Is
  
  1. In object-oriented programming, inheritance in class-based languages like Java and trait systems in Rust do not include deletion semantics and only express a one-level relationship between objects and methods. The structure corresponds to Map at the layer.
  2. The strongest form of object-oriented programming is generic objects with template metaprogramming capabilities, which can be viewed as `Map extends Map<Map>` at the structural level.
  3. If Map is extended into a Tree structure and the extends operator includes subtraction, then Tree becomes a DeltaTree with inverses, and the overall structure upgrades to `Tree x-extends Tree<Tree>`. This abstraction can naturally include abstract syntax trees and file systems, becoming a widely applicable general computing pattern that goes beyond specific programming languages. In concrete terms, this becomes the core software construction formula defined by reversible computation theory.
  
  ```
  App = Delta x-extends Generator<DSL>
  ```
  
  > Docker and k8s's kustomize can be viewed as examples of reversible computing in practice.

  ## [What Does "Reversible" Mean in Reversible Computing?](what-does-reversible-mean.md)
  
  The term "reversible" is closely tied to the concept of entropy in physics. While entropy increase determines the direction of time evolution in the physical world, reversible computing theory studies the patterns of constructing coarse-grained software structures that evolve over time. Therefore, "reversible" is a key concept in this theory. For classmates without background in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, the term may be confusing. Is "reversible" important? How can software be made reversible? Does it mean executing code in reverse? What does this imply? This article provides a simple explanation of what "reversible" means in the context of reversible computing theory.
  
  ## [Delta-Oriented Programming from the Perspective of Reversible Computing](delta-oriented-programming.md)

  ## [Design of Low-Code Platforms from a Tensor Product Perspective](tensor-product-lowcode.md)

  ## [Explanation of Delta Concept with Git and Docker as Examples](explanation-of-delta.md)
  
  While both are referred to as "deltas," there is a profound difference between delta and delta. In essence, git and docker both involve delta computation, but their deltas have fundamentally different characteristics, which can only be understood from a mathematical perspective. Common misunderstandings of delta concepts often stem from vague definitions rather than inherent contradictions.

  ## [Conditions Needed for GPT to Generate Complex Code](nop-for-gpt.md)
  

Now, many people are trying to use GPT directly to generate code, aiming to guide GPT in completing traditional coding tasks through natural language. However, very few have seriously considered the long-term maintenance challenges of the generated code. This paper analyzed the necessary conditions for using GPT to produce complex code from a theoretical perspective and proposed specific strategies for combining Nop platform with GPT.

## [How to evaluate a framework technology (e.g., ORM framework)](props-and-cons-of-orm-framework.md)

For a new framework technology, evaluations such as "very convenient, very easy to use" only represent subjective feelings. Can we define some objective standards that are not influenced by personal biases on the objective level?

## [How does Nop overcome the restriction that DSL can only be applied to specific domains?](nop-for-dsl.md)
The Nop platform can be considered as a language workbench (Language Workbench), providing comprehensive theoretical support and underlying tools for the design and development of DSLs. Using the Nop platform primarily involves expressing business logic using DSL rather than general programming languages. Some may wonder: Since DSL is called a domain-specific language, does that mean it's only applicable to a specific domain? Would this not inherently limit its use in describing business scenarios? During the popularity of the ROR (Ruby On Rails) framework, DSL concepts were briefly popularized, but they have since faded from view. What sets Nop apart? The answer is straightforward: Nop is built from scratch based on reversible computing theory to create the next-generation low-code platform, and reversible computing theory is a systematic approach to DSL design and construction at the theoretical level, addressing the issues inherent in traditional DSL design and application.

## [Why is Nop a unique open-source software development platform?](technical-strategy.md)
The essential difference between the Nop platform and other open-source software development platforms lies in that Nop platform **starts from first principles based on mathematical origins and uses rigorous mathematical derivations to gradually develop detailed designs for each layer**. Its components are consistent with mathematical principles internally, leading to significantly shorter and more efficient implementation code compared to other platforms. Additionally, **in terms of flexibility and scalability, the Nop platform surpasses all known open technologies and achieves system-level coarse-grained software reuse**. Mainstream technologies are primarily designed using a component-based approach, whose theoretical foundation limits the overall reusability of software.

## [If we were to rewrite SpringBoot, what would be our different choices?](lowcode-ioc.md)
If we were to completely re-implement SpringBoot from scratch, we would explicitly define which core problems the underlying framework should address. What solutions would we propose for these problems? How do these solutions differ fundamentally from SpringBoot's current approaches? The Nop platform's dependency injection container, NopIoC, is implemented based on reversible computing principles and approximately 5000 lines of code to replicate all dynamic auto-deployment mechanisms and AOP interception used in SpringBoot. It also integrates seamlessly with GraalVM for easy native image compilation. In this paper, I will analyze the design principles of the IoC container from the perspective of reversible computation theory, using NopIoC's implementation code as a basis.

## [What kind of ORM engine does a low-code platform need?](lowcode-orm-1.md)
What is ORM? Why can ORM simplify data access layer coding? Which common business semantics can be unified under ORM? In the context of low-code platforms, how can data structures support user-defined adjustments? What logical path between front-end UI display and back-end storage should be minimized as much as possible? How can an ORM engine support this? If we are not satisfied with predefined low-code application scenarios but aim for a smooth upgrade path from LowCode to ProCode, what requirements would we have for the ORM engine?

## [What is Data-Driven? How Does It Differ from Model-Driven, Domain-Driven, Metadata-Driven, and DSL-Driven?](what-is-data-driven.md)
"XX-Driven" is one of the most common buzzwords in software engineering. Translating it literally gives us data-driven, model-driven, domain-driven, metadata-driven, and DSL-driven, among others. A natural question arises: What's the difference between these various concepts? Why do we artificially create so many different ideas?

## [The Secret Behind Paxos Algorithm Easy for Primary Students](paxos-explained.md)
Paxos algorithm is one of the most fundamental algorithms in distributed systems, notoriously known for its complexity. Its design remains puzzling because it's difficult to intuitively understand why it was built that way. While we can verify its correctness through examples and even use mathematical proofs to convince ourselves it's correct, we still struggle to answer why this specific approach was chosen. Is there a possibility of finding an alternative explanation without relying on mathematical derivations? Could there be a more intuitive way to grasp Paxos algorithm?

## [The Essence of React from React Hooks](essence-of-react.md)

```
(props, @reactive state) => vdom
```

The render function is a hard-wired information pipeline. If we establish it once and discard it immediately, that's a huge waste. Why not reuse it? By introducing reactive state variables and establishing a global responsive rule: "No matter what causes the state to change, it will automatically trigger the local render function to execute," we can elevate the render function to its full potential, **perfectly embedding microscopic interactivity into the broader information flow scenario**.
