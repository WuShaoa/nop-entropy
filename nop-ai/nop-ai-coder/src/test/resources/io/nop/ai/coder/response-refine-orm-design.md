[NO_CHANGE]

The existing table design already comprehensively covers all the requirements mentioned in the detailed design document, including:

1. All core entities for material management, supplier management, service company management, and basic menu management
2. Complete inventory management with warehouses, stock in/out operations, and inventory checks
3. Supplier settlement and payment tracking
4. Operation data management for daily operations
5. All necessary relationships between entities

The schema supports:
- Multi-level material categorization
- Menu and recipe management
- Daily menu planning
- Inventory tracking with min/max levels
- Full audit trails for all transactions
- Financial settlement processes
- Operational data analysis

No additional tables are needed as the current design already implements all the business rules and workflows described in the requirements. The permission and role management aspects are explicitly excluded from scope as per the requirements.
