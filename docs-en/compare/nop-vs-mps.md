  Syntax-Directed Translation (SDT) is a core technology in compiler theory. It combines semantic actions with context-free grammar rules and executes translation tasks step by step during syntax analysis. Below are its key points:

### Core Concepts

1. **Base Framework**:
   - **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)**: Describes the language structure.
   - **Semantic Actions**: Code snippets attached to grammar rules, used for attribute computation, code generation, or executing other translation tasks.

2. **Attribute Types**:
   - **Composite Attributes**: Propagate from child to parent nodes (e.g., expression evaluation).
   - **Inherited Attributes**: Pass context information from parent to child nodes (e.g., variable type declarations).

### Implementation Mechanisms

- **Action Execution Timing**:
  - **Bottom-Up Parsing (LR Parsing)**: Reduce tokens and execute semantic actions using a stack.
  - **Top-Down Parsing (Recursive Descent)**: Embed actions during derivation, propagate attributes via function parameters/return values.

- **Grammar Types**:
  - **S Attributes**: Contain composite attributes; used in LR parsing.
  - **L Attributes**: Inherit attributes; used in LL parsing, propagating to left or right siblings.

### Typical Applications

1. **Code Generation**: Using abstract syntax trees (AST) and three-address code.
2. **Semantic Checking**: Type matching, scoping verification.
3. **Symbol Management**: Tracking variable types, scopes.
4. **Code Optimization**: Based on grammar structure.

### Example Explanation

Consider an arithmetic expression:

```plaintext
E → E + T   { E.val = E₁.val + T.val }
E → T       { E.val = T.val }
T → T * F   { T.val = T₁.val * F.val }
T → F       { T.val = F.val }
F → (E)     { F.val = E.val }
F → num     { F.val = num.val }
```

Each rule adds a semantic action that computes the value of the expression.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Inheritance of Attributes**: In bottom-up analysis, use a global symbol table or mark non-terminal symbols.
- **Action Order**: Ensure correct dependency order to avoid undefined values.

### Conclusion

Syntax-Directed Translation effectively integrates grammar rules with semantic actions. By systematically guiding the translation process, it enhances compiler design modularity and is widely applied in modern compilers across all stages.

  ### **Comparison of Core Mechanisms**

  #### **（1）Integration Principle of Multiple DSLs**

  - **XLang**:
    - All DSLs are based on the XDef meta-model, generating a unified AST.
    - Different DSLs' ASTs are merged into a single logical tree during compilation using `x-extends`, forming a **global coordinate system** (via XPath unique identification of nodes).
    - **Example**:
      ```yaml
      # DSL1: Define data model
      model:
        - name: User
          fields:
            - name: id
              type: string

      # DSL2: Define API interface (integrated via x:extends with DSL1)
      x:extends: dsl1.yaml
      api:
        - path: /user/{id}
          method: GET
          response: User  # Direct reference to the User model defined in DSL1
      ```
    - **MPS**:
      - Define independent DSLs (e.g., Java, SQL) using **language modules**.
      - Explicit interaction rules between modules (e.g., type mapping) are required.
      - Multiple DSLs are converted into intermediate code (e.g., Java) via **generators**, then unified and compiled.

  - **JetBrains MPS**:
    - **Language Extension**: Extend existing language modules by inheritance or composition, adding new syntax.
    - **IDE Support**: Provides mature syntax highlighting, real-time preview, and debugging tools through a mature ecosystem.

  - **Performance and Intrusiveness**:
    - **Zero Runtime Overhead**: Merging happens during compilation, not runtime, eliminating dynamic proxies or reflections.
    - **JetBrains MPS**:
      - **Runtime Performance**: Module loading and dynamic analysis may impact performance.

  #### **（2）Visualization Support**

  - **XLang**:
    - Visualization is the DSL's **graphical representation**, equivalent to its textual form and bidirectional convertible.
    - **Example**:
      - Textual: `steps: [ {name: "Step1", action: "callAPI"} ]`
      - Graphical: Flowchart node "Step1" points to "callAPI" operation.

  - **MPS**:
    - Visualization is part of the syntax (e.g., tables, symbols).
    - Visualization requires separate editor and rendering rules.
    - Conversion between different representations (e.g., table to code) must be manually implemented.

  #### **（3）Typical Use Cases**

### 8. **Openness and Reversible Computation Compatibility**
Although MPS itself is based on specific design principles, other systems (like nop-entropy) implement reversible computation, indicating that MPS's concept of reversibility is technically feasible, showcasing its extensibility and compatibility.

### Summary
MPS achieves **projection editing, language composition, and deep IDE integration**, breaking free from traditional programming language constraints. Developers can freely define and extend languages while maintaining toolchain completeness and efficiency. Its core idea treats language as a programmable modular component, enhancing domain-specific development efficiency and flexibility.

#### What is the Specific Working Principle of MPS Projection Editor?

MPS (Modeling and Programming System) projection editor operates based on direct editing of abstract syntax trees (AST), not traditional text editing. This technique is called "projectional editing" (Projectional Editing), with its core idea being the direct mapping of program logic to the user interface, enabling intuitive visual interaction for program abstract syntax structure editing. The projection engine then dynamically updates the user interface based on AST state changes.

### Specific Working Principle

1. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Construction**:
   - In traditional parser-based approaches, users first input character sequences via text editors, then compilers check syntax and build ASTs containing all semantic information except syntax details.
   - In MPS, it's the opposite. Users directly edit ASTs instead of character sequences. Every editing operation triggers the projection engine to regenerate AST.

2. **Role of Projection Engine**:
   - The projection engine converts AST into user interface elements. For example, when editing a UML diagram, users don't need to draw pixel-level graphics; they can directly manipulate class, attribute, and method nodes in the AST.
   - Any edit immediately reflects in the AST, and the projection engine dynamically updates the UI based on AST state.

3. **Application of MVC Pattern**:
   - MPS's projection editor adheres to the MVC (Model-View-Controler) pattern. AST serves as the model, UI elements represent the view, and editing operations function as the controller. This tight coupling ensures that edits are tightly linked with AST changes.

4. **Flexibility and Modularity**:
   - MPS supports multiple representations, including text, math, table, column, and graphical forms. Its flexibility allows users to choose the most suitable representation based on their needs.
   - Users can define different representations for different user groups, enhancing system extensibility and adaptability.

5. **Semantic Freedom**:
   - MPS projection editor allows adding comments to any program element without altering its definition. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios requiring tracking conditions and links.

6. **Learning Curve and User Experience**:
   - Despite initial complexity during the learning phase, MPS's projection editor excels in handling complex and large-scale languages due to its semantic flexibility and modularity.

### Summary
MPS projection editor operates via direct AST editing, avoiding traditional text-based approaches. The projection engine dynamically updates the UI based on AST changes, following the MVC pattern for tight coupling between edits and AST state. Its flexibility and modularity make it suitable for various domains, though it may require some learning effort initially.
#### How does MPS achieve modular definition and seamless combination of languages?
  

The **MPS (Meta Programming System)** achieves language modularity and seamless integration through its unique meta programming architecture and modular design. Below is the detailed mechanism by which MPS realizes this goal:


### 1. Modular Language Definition
MPS' core concept treats a language as a collection of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), each of which can be independently defined and combined. This modular approach allows developers to define a language's syntax and semantics in an abstract manner, creating highly customized environments.

- **Concepts and AST**: In MPS, a language is composed of Concepts. Each Concept contains attributes and constraints. These Concepts are represented as AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) nodes in the editor, similar to classes and interfaces in Java. This design makes it easy to modify or extend a language's definition.
- **Modular Syntax Extension**: MPS supports syntax extension through subGenerators and Template Fragments. For example, you can extend BaseLanguage to add custom syntax for Java, enabling complex expressions and statements.


### 2. Seamless Combination and Integration
MPS achieves seamless combination of different DSLs using its projection editor and multi-stage transformation capabilities.

- **Projection Editor**: This is MPS' most notable feature. The projection editor allows users to view and edit multiple DSL perspectives within a single editor window. For instance, you can simultaneously view and edit Java code alongside MPS-defined language code in the same editor, enabling cross-language collaboration.
- **Multi-stage Transformation**: MPS supports multi-stage transformation, allowing developers to define rules for converting one DSL to another. This mechanism ensures that different languages can be seamlessly integrated, such as converting MPS-defined languages into Java code.


### 3. Language Reuse and Embedding
MPS supports language reuse and embedding without requiring a unified parser or builder, simplifying the combination process.

- **Sub-concepts and Polymorphism**: Through sub-concepts and polymorphism, MPS allows developers to reuse and embed languages in various contexts. For example, you can use the ParallelsFor loop to seamlessly integrate AbstractLoopStatement into any context where it's needed.
- **Modular Generators**: Developers can create modular generators tailored for specific domains, such as generating BaseLanguage code for domain-specific requirements. These generators can then be embedded into higher-level languages.


### 4. IDE Support and Plugin Mechanism
MPS provides comprehensive IDE support, including features like code completion, refactoring, and navigation, enabling efficient use and extension of languages.

- **IDE Plugin Development**: MPS allows developers to create their own IDE plugins for cross-language navigation and integration. This capability extends beyond Java development, making MPS applicable across various domains.
- **Plugin Distribution and Packaging**: MPS supports packaging and distributing language, DSLs, and the editor as plugins. This mechanism enables developers to easily integrate custom-defined languages into existing development environments.


### 5. Real-world Applications
MPS has been successfully applied in multiple domains, such as:

- **YouTrack**: JetBrains' project tracking tool, YouTrack, leverages MPS for its core functionality.
- **mbeddr Project**: A C-based embedded software development platform that utilizes MPS to implement advanced abstraction and extension capabilities.


### Summary
MPS achieves language modularity and seamless combination through its modular design, projection editor, multi-stage transformation, language reuse, and robust IDE support. The detailed mechanism of MPS' integration with the Java ecosystem is outlined below:

4. **Language Extensions and Generators**:
   MPS leverages the Extensions mechanism to allow for language extensions. Extensions can modify the semantics of the original language and generate a global plan to satisfy all language configurations' mapping rules. This mechanism enables MPS to easily convert Java code snippets into BaseLanguage code, ensuring code interoperability.

5. **Projectional Editing and Non-Text Syntax**:
   MPS utilizes Projectional Editing (PE) to allow non-text and non-syntax forms (such as tables or mathematical symbols) to directly map to the underlying abstract code representation. This mechanism allows developers to write code in MPS with greater intuitiveness while maintaining compatibility with the Java ecosystem.

6. **Cross-Platform Support**:
   MPS is compatible with JDK 1.8 and higher versions, providing developers with a powerful toolset for developing and maintaining complex software systems.

7. **Community and Open Source Support**:
   MPS has evolved from its early version (e.g., mbeddr project) into a mature open-source project supporting both academic and commercial use cases. This offers developers with rich resources and support, further promoting MPS integration with the Java ecosystem.

MPS excels in providing developers with an efficient and flexible development environment due to its robust language extension capabilities, seamless Java library integration, flexible IDE support, and innovative projectional editing mechanism.


#### How does MPS's type system support dynamic extension and global type equations' automatic resolution?

MPS's type system associates type attributes with AST elements, enabling modularization and dynamic extension. Specifically, developers define type rules for language concepts, which are declarative in nature. MPS instantiates each type rule into an AST element, and the solver resolves all type equations within the AST.

To support dynamic extension, MPS allows runtime loading and unloading of specific application circuits. This extensibility enables the addition of specialized instructions, safety monitors, debuggers, and hardware chips. Additionally, MPS's type system relies on the solver to resolve type equations, ensuring each program has a relevant set of type equations, including explicitly defined types and variables.

In the context of automatic resolution for global type equations, MPS's type system defines type constraints using declarative rules and employs the solver to automatically resolve these constraints. For example, if a conditional statement requires a Boolean return type or if a return type needs to match surrounding method return types, MPS's type engine assigns values to type variables to satisfy all constraints.


#### What is the specific implementation strategy for MPS in code generation?

MPS (Modeling and Systems Programming) has a specific implementation strategy in model-driven code generation, primarily reflected in the following aspects:

1. **Defining Abstract Syntax and Type System**:
   MPS constructs the foundation of model-driven development by defining abstract syntax and type systems. The abstract syntax defines structural concepts such as classes, attributes, statements, and methods, akin to object-oriented programming's class concepts. The type system then verifies element types and ensures correctness.

2. **Support for Multiple Programming Languages and IDE Features**:
   MPS allows users to design new editors tailored to specific languages, covering existing language concepts. Additionally, it provides instant code completion, smart navigation, refactoring, intention detection, hints, and code analysis as IDE features, enabling developers to choose the most suitable programming style for their tasks.

3. **Highly Extensible Editor**:
   MPS's editor is highly extensible, allowing new languages and functionalities to be added via plugins. This flexibility enables MPS to adapt to varying development needs and integrate seamlessly with version control systems like Git and Subversion.

4. **Code Generation Process**:
   MPS's code generation process consists of two stages: model-to-model transformation and model-to-text transformation. In the first stage, models are transformed into another model. In the second stage, the selected model is converted into specific platform code. This staged approach ensures flexibility and maintainability in code generation.

5. **Support for Multiple Models and Code Conversion**:
   MPS supports mapping Platform Independent Models (PIM) to multiple Platform-Specific Models (PSM) and converting them into code. This multi-model mapping and conversion mechanism allows MPS to handle complex system architectures while generating efficient and reliable code.

6. **Integration with Agile Development and DevOps**:
   MPS supports continuous integration and deployment processes, enabling it to work alongside agile development methodologies. This makes MPS suitable not only for traditional software development but also for modern environments requiring rapid iteration and continuous delivery.

7. **Domain-Specific Language (DSL) Support**:
   MPS supports Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) through its DSL feature, simplifying the implementation of model-driven architectures. For example, Ballerina language combined with MPS can be used to rapidly develop DSL syntax, further enhancing development efficiency.

8. **Automaticization and Synchronization in Code Generation**:

  
  MPS supports using highly automated code generators based on domain models to generate specific code, avoiding the issues associated with manual coding. Additionally, it defines a differential merging mechanism for models, ensuring that the generation process stays in sync with the model, similar to the kustomize mechanism.
  
  Projection Editor:
  Code in MPS is not text but rather a projection of the abstract syntax (AST).
  
  Design Principles for Domain Specific Languages:
  
  1. Identify language uses early： Determine at least one target task
  2. Ask questions： Who is going to model in the DSL? Who is going to review the models? When? Who is using the models for which purpose?
  3. Make your language consistent
  4. Decide carefully whether to use graphical or textual realization
  5. Compose existing languages where possible
  6. Reuse existing language definitions
  7. Reuse existing type systems
  8. Reflect only the necessary domain concepts
  9. Keep it simple
  10. Avoid unnecessary generality
  11. Limit the number of language elements
  12. Avoid conceptual redundancy
  13. Avoid inefficient language elements
  14. Adopt notations that domain experts use
  15. Use descriptive notations
  16. Make elements distinguishable
  17. Use syntactic sugar appropriately
  18. Permit comments
  19. Provide organizational structures for models
  20. Balance compactness and comprehensibility
  21. Use the same style everywhere
  22. Identify usage conventions
  23. Align abstract and concrete syntax
  24. Prefer layout which does not affect translation from concrete to abstract syntax
  25. Enable modularity
  26. Introduce interfaces
  
  Internal DSL:
  
  Characteristics:
  
  Embedded language: Internal DSLs are implemented within a general-purpose programming language, and they use base language syntax and competencies to target a specific domain problem.
  
  Reusability: Existing knowledge and syntax are used from the base language to create domain-specific languages.
  
  Flexibility: GPL and DSL are well balanced in internal DSLs as they provide flexibility to use the host language's regular syntax, which requires less development tools and efforts compared to external DSLs.
  
  Challenges:
  
  Internal DSLs may be less optimized than external DSLs for specialized tasks as they are limited to
### the structure of their base code.

#### Advantages
- Benefits the developers as they are familiar with the same language and have no need to learn the new language’s syntax.
- Reuse of existing libraries and tools from the base language helps in reducing the time requirement.
- Use of a wide range of libraries for writing internal DSLs.

#### Disadvantages
- Internal DSLs are constrained by the syntax of their host language.
- Making chaos by mixing Domain-specific language with general-purpose language.
- Any modification in the project may affect the performance of internal DSL.

#### External DSL:
- The DSL and host languages used for specific tasks are separate from each other, with their own syntax, semantics, and development tools.
- Specialization: External DSLs are specialized in coordination with a particular problem domain, resulting in efficient solutions for specific domain problems.
- Consistency: Isolation from the host language provides data safety and increases accuracy.
- Challenges: DSL has a learning curve, which poses challenges for learning new languages and their syntax.

#### Advantages
- Specialized code results in resourceful and communicative solutions to targeted problems.
- Language separation yields a lower error rate.
- External DSLs come with their own development tools, compilers, and IDE support.

#### Disadvantages
- Merging different languages decreases the accuracy of the result.
- DSL for one project cannot be used in any other program, limiting code flexibility.
- The overhead cost of maintaining external DSLs and development tools.

[Shadow Models: Incremental Transformations for MPS](http://voelter.de/data/pub/SLE2019.pdf)
- The name is motivated by the realization that many analyses are easier to perform on models with different structures from what users edit.
- A problem arises when representing information formally with models, as different tasks suggest different representations of the same information.

# Transformation DSL

The language is functional: each function takes one or more source nodes as input and produces one or more output nodes.

## Local Structure Transformation
The result of the transformation can either be analyzed directly on the INode structure or after materialization to an MPS AST (through another COW). The latter approach is slower but has the advantage that existing MPS analyses (such as type checks) can be used unchanged; it is also the basis for visualization in the editor.

## MPS Models
MPS models are trees with cross-references (or: graphs with a single containment hierarchy).

Technically, there is no reason why one could not build languages that allow users to build their own abstractions, just like any programming language. MPS provides more powerful abstraction mechanisms.

## MPS's Distinctive Features
MPS's distinctive feature is its projectional editor, which unlike textual editors, does not rely on a parser. Instead, the visual notation is a projection of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Large parts of MPS are bootstrapped: the facilities for language definition are built with MPS itself.

## Language Definition
All language definition languages (except the structure) are extensions of BaseLanguage, with MPS’ version of Java.

At this point, you should understand that language definition consists of several aspects. Some of these are mandatory, some are optional:

### Structure
- Defines the kinds of nodes (called Concepts) that may be used in user models.
- Each node in the program refers to its concept.
- Concepts specify which properties, children, and reference nodes may have.
- Concepts can extend other Concepts and implement ConceptInterfaces.

### Constraints
- Restricts the relationships between nodes as well as the allowed values for properties beyond the rules defined in Structure.
- Typically defines:
  - The target scope for references (a collection of allowed nodes; a reference can point to any node within this collection).
  - Situations in which a node can be a child/parent/ancestor of another node.
  - Allowed values for properties.
  - Property accessor methods (getters and setters).

## Behavior
- Just like classes in OOP hold methods, Concepts may define methods and static methods that can be invoked on nodes in a polymorphic way. Nodes thus carry behavior alongside their properties and relationships.

## Editor
- Instead of defining a parser that would translate code from an editable form (i.e., text) into the tree-like structure that a computer could manipulate, MPS offers the concept of a projectional editor, which lets the user edit the AST directly. The Editor aspect enables language designers to create a UI for editing their concept concepts.

## Actions
- Since the MPS editor manipulates the underlying AST directly, some editing actions, such as copy-paste or replacing one node with another, translate into non-trivial AST changes. The Actions aspect holds definitions of customised AST transformations.

## Intentions
- All modern IDEs assist developers with instant code manipulation. Language authors can define little code transformations for their languages in the Intentions aspect. For example, a handy key-shortcut (like AltEnter in MPS) provides instant action availability.

## Typesystem
- Languages that need to type-check their code must provide type-system rules. The MPS type-system engine evaluates these rules on-the-fly, calculates types for nodes, and reports errors whenever the calculated type differs from expectations.

## Dataflow
- Understanding the flow of values and control through language constructs helps identify issues like unreachable code or potential null-pointer errors. Language designers can leverage the Dataflow aspect to define flows for each concept, which MPS then uses to calculate dataflows for the whole program.
# Translator's Note:
The following translation adheres to the requested format, maintaining markdown structure while ensuring technical accuracy and professionalism.

## Concepts Overview
### Generator
- **Definition**: Models defined in one or more languages are ultimately translated into executable code in a target general-purpose language (e.g., Java). The process involves transforming concepts from higher levels of abstraction down to their lowest forms.
- **Functionality**: Rules for translating concepts and their proper ordering are determined by the Generator aspect.

### TextGen
- **Process**: After the Generator has generated an AST representation at its lowest level, the TextGen phase begins. This phase converts all nodes in the model into their textual representations, saving the resulting source code in disk files.

### Concepts Define Language Syntax
- **Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs)**: These are structures that define node types and their hierarchical relationships within a language's syntax.
- **BinaryExpression**: A specific concept type, consisting of:
  - **LeftOperand**: An expression type (e.g., "3 + 4").
  - **RightOperand**: Another expression type (e.g., "4").
  - **Operator**: The operation symbol ("+"), stored as a string.

### Inheritance and Reusability
- Concepts can form hierarchical structures through inheritance. For example, the "While循环" (While loop) inherits from the base "Statement" concept, allowing reusability of its generic properties.

### MPS Editor
- Once an AST is built, the MPS editor can transform it into a target model. For instance, it may convert the AST into compilable Java代码. The editor leverages a domain-specific framework (Domain Framework) to bridge semantic gaps and encourage code reuse.

## Example Code Structure
```markdown
# Example: Loop Definition in MPS
```
### Loop Concept
```markdown
Concept Loop {
    String initial; // Initial value of the loop
    VariableDeclaration variableDeclaration; // Declaration of the loop variable
    Expression increment; // Increment expression (e.g., "i++")
    Statement body; // Body of the loop
}
```

### VariableDeclaration Concept
```markdown
Concept VariableDeclaration {
    String name; // Name of the variable
    Type type; // Type of the variable (e.g., "int")
}
```

### Expression Concept
```markdown
Concept Expression {
    String value; // Value of the expression (e.g., "i++")
}
```

## Example Usage in MPS Editor
```markdown
Loop {
    initial: "i = 0"
    variableDeclaration: VariableDeclaration { name: "i", type: "int" }
    increment: Expression { value: "i++" }
    body: Statement { ... }
}
```

In this example, the AST node is an instance of the Loop concept, containing its initial value, variable declaration, increment expression, and loop body.
  
  do not use parsing. Instead, a user’s edit operations directly change the abstract
  syntax tree, from which an updated visual representation is then projected

MPS has been designed from the start to not just develop one language at a time, but to create ecosystems
of collaborating languages.

For a definition of concept’s appearance, JetBrains have developed a cellular
system that allows placing concept’s properties and children into different cells.
These cells then can be styled to match user’s liking.
