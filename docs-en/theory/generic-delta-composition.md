# The General Delta Difference Mechanism

**Any dynamic update (extension) technology fundamentally defines a Delta difference space and the feasible structure composition operations.** A careful examination reveals that commonly referred to as dynamic updates are essentially defining extension points on already constructed structures, then inserting compatible interface-compliant structures into these extension points.

The complexity of dynamic Delta updates is evident in three key aspects:

1. How to design extension points to satisfy future unknown Delta update requirements?
2. How to seamlessly integrate externally introduced Delta structures with existing ones?
3. How to ensure state consistency between Delta updates and runtime states?

Additionally, one might question: Since all business logic structures inherently have potential dynamic update needs, **why must each specific structure be tailored with its own Delta update scheme?** Can a unified solution address the three technical challenges mentioned above?

## The Relational Model's Success Factors

To address these questions, we can look to the relational model's historical development. Before the relational database era, data storage was as diverse as the world of yin and yang. However, the relational model's success lies in its standardized storage mechanisms. It abandoned inherent data associations **focusing solely on atomic, non-redundant data**, which are then methodically processed through various derived operations. All data relationships were severed, leaving only identifier fields (id and ref_id) to maintain association information. Runtime operations rely on immediate lookups or scans **reconstructing relationships on the fly**.

The relational model's strength lies in its ability to enforce standardization in data storage and retrieval processes. While it discards natural data relationships, it ensures that all operations are grounded in standardized, non-redundant data structures. This approach simplifies data management and reduces potential for errors, making it easier to maintain consistent data integrity.

## Standardized Data Operations

To achieve this standardization, the relational model relies on **immediate computations** (using indexes for fast lookups or full table scans) rather than complex joins. Relationships are reconstructed during runtime, often leveraging ORM engines to translate between structured query languages and underlying data models.

For consistent Delta updates that avoid ambiguity and redundancy, the relational approach minimizes data transformations. It avoids complicating data structures with unnecessary associations, instead maintaining a clear separation of concerns between data storage and its usage.

## Nop Platform's XLang Mechanism

Nop platform's XLang is akin to a comprehensive toolkit for structure definitions, including parsing, transformation, analysis, and generation tools. Its success stems from enabling Delta updates without concerning itself with data relationships, unlike traditional object-oriented systems which often tie data and functions together.

XLang's advantage lies in its ability to handle standardized Delta operations on XDSL-structured data, ensuring that changes propagate correctly through the system. It allows for dynamic adjustments while maintaining consistent data structures.

## Model Loading Process Overview

```javascript
DslModel = ResourceComponentManager.instance().loadComponentModel(modelPath)
```

This code snippet illustrates how models are loaded in the Nop platform. The `modelPath` is processed through the `ResourceComponentManager`, resulting in a compiled DslModel for efficient runtime operations.

In functional programming terms, this process corresponds to:

```
modelPath => XDSL => DslModel
```

Once the DSL (Data Structure Language) file is modified, the DslModel automatically re-parses and updates accordingly, ensuring all changes are reflected accurately in runtime operations.

## Microservices Architecture Insights

The microservices architecture's success lies in its ability to enable **Dynamic Rolling Updates** without relying on monolithic structures. Unlike traditional object-oriented systems where functions and data are tightly coupled, microservices decouple them, allowing for independent updates and scaling.

Microservices' no-state design approach resolves the challenges of local updates in distributed systems. It separates runtime state from data storage, enabling each service to manage its own state without conflicts or data entanglement.

## Accessing Microservices

When interacting with microservices, you typically start by accessing a service registry via an arbitrary name (e.g., "service-discovery"). This registry uses DNS or HTTP-based lookup mechanisms to locate the required service instance. Once identified, you pass it your input parameters.

The service instance then processes these inputs, loading necessary data from its persistent storage. If using functional programming languages, this corresponds to:

```
modelPath => XDSL => DslModel
```

This ensures that any changes in the DSL automatically propagate through the system without affecting runtime operations unless explicitly required.


```
  serviceName => Service => input => state => Result
```

Similarly, in the Nop platform, all model processing follows the same logic structure.

```
  modelPath => XDSL => DslModel => arguments => scope => Result
```

Similar to microservices, the DSL model's dynamic update can also be independent of data migration within the state space.
