# Usage Patterns

* `/command ` Launch a command
* File specification in the form of `@fileName.txt`
* On each run, automatically commit and generate git diff. Use `/revert` to roll back.
* Use Jupyter notebook for interactive testing
* After `/conf human_as_mode:true`, copy the prompt to the clipboard manually
* For library introduction, use `/lib /add libName`
* Each interaction generates a `chat_action.yaml` with complete interaction history
* Add URL support with `/conf rag_url:url`
* Start a Web IDE with `autocoder.web` and execute in terminal
