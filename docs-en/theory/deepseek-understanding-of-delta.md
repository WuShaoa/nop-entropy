# DeepSeek AI for Delta Customization - Beyond Ordinary Programmers

DeepSeek is a product developed by the company DeepSeek. It is fast, affordable, and the latest version, DeepSeek-v3, is claimed to surpass Claude 3.5 Sonnet in speed and performance. In fact, it ranks first in the multilingual programming test rankings, just behind OpenAI o1.

[https://chat.deepseek.com/](https://chat.deepseek.com/) This chat product provides a 【DeepSeek】mode where you can observe AI's reasoning process. Below is a discussion of Delta customization concepts through DeepSeek AI. You'll notice its depth and breadth exceed that of ordinary programmers, including those with some understanding of fine-grained reuse, macroscopic architectural design, etc., among certain communities.

**Question 1**: How to implement arbitrary bean definitions and modifications without modifying existing jar files in a Springboot framework?

**Answer 1**: This question is set for a specific discussion context. DeepSeek AI lists some customization methods available in the SpringBoot framework, but they are lengthy and not our focus, so we omit the response.

**Question 2**: What is NopIoC's Delta customization approach? Its principle seems simple: merge Delta configurations into the IoC container before it parses XML layers. The same Delta algorithm can be applied to XML/JSON/YAML tree structures for merging. It occurs during model loading and doesn't affect runtime performance, ensuring compatibility with any runtime engine that uses DSL descriptions.

**Answer 2**: Omitting this response as it overlaps with the next question's answer.

**Question 3**: Is Delta customization limited to Spring bean configurations, or can it be applied universally across all DSLs? For instance, MyBatis' mapper.xml, workflow.xml, rule.xml, and batch.xml are examples. Essentially, any engine that abstracts a model can have an implicit model abstraction stored as text, which is itself a DSL. Delta customization refers to applying a unified mechanism for modifying any tree-structured DSL. Since all languages have ASTs, any DSL inherently can be expressed using Tree structures.

**Answer 3**: Below is DeepSeek AI's response along with some targeted explanations. The chat product translates into English as follows:

> Good, I'm trying to understand Delta customization, especially how it works across various DSLs beyond just Spring beans. NopIoC's Delta customization isn't limited to Spring configurations; it can apply to any tree-structured DSL, like XML, JSON, or YAML.

> First, I need to grasp what Delta customization entails. From the conversation, it seems like a way to modify DSL configurations without altering original code or files. It allows incremental or custom changes in the model loading phase based on existing configurations, avoiding the need to edit JAR files or core configurations.

> For example, with Spring beans, you might have a beans.xml file (though XML configuration is less common than Java-based configs). Delta customization lets you specify changes via another file, such as adding new beans, deleting existing ones, or modifying their properties. These changes are merged into the IoC container before it parses XML layers.

> Extending this concept to other DSLs makes sense. For instance, MyBatis uses mapper.xml to define how Java interfaces map to SQL statements. If you need to customize these mappings without editing the original file, Delta customization can help by allowing additional mappings or modifications through a separate file.

> The key point is that these DSLs are inherently tree-structured, whether in XML, JSON, or YAML. Since they all have ASTs, Delta customization provides a generic mechanism for modifying them, ensuring compatibility with various runtime engines and their DSL descriptions.

> But I'm curious about how this mechanism operates under the hood. How does the system know which parts of the tree to modify, add, or delete? Is there a standard way to specify these increments, or does each DSL have its own method?

### Technical Document Translation

#### Key Differences and Advantages
The key difference lies in how differences are defined and merged. Unlike traditional approaches where each DSL (Domain Specific Language) defines its own way of handling differences, Nop platform leverages unified difference definitions and algorithms under reversible computation theory.

For example, in Spring XML configuration:

```xml
<beans x:extends="super">
  <bean id="myBean" class="com.example.MyBean">
    <property name="myList">
      <list x:override="append">
        <value>value1</value>
      </list>
    </property>

    <property name="myMap" x:override="remove" />
  </bean>
</beans>
```

- `x:extends` attribute specifies the parent configuration file to inherit from.
- `x:override` attribute determines the operation (add, remove, or modify) to be performed.
- `append` and `remove` are specific merge operators used for adding or removing elements.

Each node and property within the structure has a unique path. **In Nop platform, each child node must have either `name` or `id` attributes for unique identification, ensuring stable coordinates even after insertions or deletions.**

#### Performance Considerations
- Since all merges are performed during model loading (before application startup), runtime performance is not affected.
- However, if there are numerous increments to apply, this could impact initial load times.

#### Delayed Loading and Compilation
1. **Lazy Loading**: Models are loaded on demand rather than at startup, reducing unnecessary initial loads.
2. **Precompilation**: Since model parsing and merging are independent of runtime logic, they can be compiled during the build process (e.g., using Maven). The resulting merged files are stored in the `_delta` directory, which takes precedence over standard file paths during application startup.

If a file is annotated with `x:validated="true"`, it indicates that it has already been merged and should not undergo dynamic generation or merging.

#### Debugging and Management
- In debug mode, Nop platform automatically generates and stores all final merged files in the `_dump` directory for easier inspection.
- Placing these files directly in the `_delta` directory allows you to bypass dynamic merging during debugging.

#### Managing Multiple Incremental Files
- In large applications with numerous configuration files, tracking all increments can become cumbersome. A systematic approach is recommended to manage and prioritize these changes effectively.

#### Virtual File System (VFS) Configuration
Nop platform uses a unified virtual file system to manage all DSL files. You can define multiple hierarchical delta directories using the `nop.core.vfs.delta-layer-ids` configuration:

```properties
nop.core.vfs.delta-layer-ids=deploy,product
```

This configuration specifies that files in the `_delta/deploy` directory will override those in `_delta/product`, and files in non-Delta directories will take precedence.

#### Comparison with Other Configuration Management Techniques
- In Spring Boot, properties files and environment-specific configurations allow for some level of customization without code changes. However, this is typically limited to overriding values rather than modifying configuration structures.
- **Delta-based customization** seems to offer more power but also introduces complexity. While it allows for precise modifications by changing the structure itself, it requires a deeper understanding of how configurations are used and modified across different layers.

#### Interesting Observations
It's fascinating how AI can recognize that modifying the structure (as opposed to just values) can lead to more powerful yet complex solutions. This distinction is crucial in real-world applications where both flexibility and performance are key.

#### Example Scenario
Consider a rule engine with a `rule.xml` file defining business rules. Instead of directly modifying `rule.xml`, you create an increment file for each new rule or modification. The engine merges these increment files with the existing configuration before loading it, avoiding direct modification of the base file.

# Benefits of Incremental Configuration Management

This method has several advantages. First, it preserves the integrity of the original configuration, which helps in tracking changes and maintaining different environments (e.g., development, testing, production). Second, since changes are isolated within incremental files, updates and maintenance become easier.

However, I need to consider potential issues. For example, if different parts of the configuration have dependencies, how does the system handle conflicts or ensure that increments do not break these dependencies? Some validation mechanisms may be required to check the integrity after merging.

## Technical Explanation: Delta Merge Algorithm

The **Delta Merge Algorithm** operates at the **XNode structure level**. It doesn't require knowledge of any DSL semantics; it only needs to follow fixed rules for merging. This is similar to how Docker images are layered, where multiple images are stacked together, and the final result ensures a valid file system and valid files.

However, internal interdependencies within files may be a concern, which is a specific business problem unrelated to Docker technology. Each application should handle this internally.

To simplify the implementation of DSLs, the **Nop platform** provides an **XDef meta-model** for enforcing constraints on merged DSL structures. This ensures that after merging, the configuration remains valid and adheres to defined rules.

```xml
<orm x:schema="/nop/schema/orm.xdef">
</orm>
```

For example, referring to the ORM model file (`orm.xdef`), the merged result must comply with the `orm.xdef` meta-model. This defines nodes and attributes along with their types and constraints.

If the configuration itself is redundant, it can be dynamically generated during compilation using meta-programming mechanisms, thus avoiding redundancy in the configuration.

## Potential Challenges: Version Control

Additionally, how does version control work? If multiple developers are working on different increments, how are their changes merged without causing conflicts? This could become complex, especially if increments target the same parts of the configuration tree.

## Technical Explanation: Nop Platform's Delta Customization

The **Nop platform** places a strong emphasis on genericity. The **Delta customization** in **NopIoC** is designed to handle any DSL through a unified framework. It doesn't require custom integration for each specific configuration file; instead, it provides a generic approach that can be applied across all DSLs.

This genericity is particularly useful when dealing with complex configurations. For instance, if you have a large number of configuration files, the **Nop platform** allows you to manage them uniformly using its meta-model (`XDef`).

```xml
<orm x:schema="/nop/schema/orm.xdef">
</orm>
```

The merged result must adhere to the `orm.xdef` meta-model. This ensures that all nodes and attributes are defined correctly, along with their constraints.

## YAML Configuration Example

Here's an example of a YAML configuration:

```yaml
xmlns:x: /nop/schema/xdsl.xdef
x:schema: /nop/schema/task/task.xdef
steps:
  - type: sequential
    name: test
    steps:
      - type: xpl
        name: step1
        source: >
          return "OK1";
      - type: xpl
        name: step2
        inputs:
          - name: result
            source: RESULT
            source: >
              return result == "OK1" ? "OK" : "FAIL";
```

This YAML configuration is equivalent to the following XML configuration:

```xml
<orm x:schema="/nop/schema/xdsl.xdef">
  <x:schema href="/nop/schema/task/task.xdef"/>
  <steps>
    <step type="sequential">
      <test>
        <step type="xpl">
          <step1 return="OK1"/>
        </step>
        <step type="xpl">
          <step2 result="RESULT">
            <return result="OK1">OK</return>
            <return result="FAIL">FAIL</return>
          </step2>
        </step>
      </test>
    </step>
  </steps>
</orm>
```

```xml
<task x:schema="/nop/schema/task/task.xdef" xmlns:x="/nop/schema/xdsl.xdef">
    <steps>
        <sequential name="test">
            <steps>
                <xpl name="step1">
                    <source>
                        return "OK1";
                    </source>
                </xpl>

                <xpl name="step2">
                    <input name="result">
                        <source>RESULT</source>
                    </input>
                    <source>
                        return result == "OK1" ? "OK" : "FAIL";
                    </source>
                </xpl>
            </steps>
        </sequential>
    </steps>
</task>
```

When defining logic with complex nested structures, especially when supporting meta-programming, XML is more advantageous compared to YAML. For a detailed analysis of XML and JSON advantages and disadvantages, refer to [Why the Nop platform chooses XML over JSON or YAML](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/651450252).

Further, the visualization in the Nop platform is considered as an information structure (visualization layer vs. text layer). Therefore, it attempts to establish a series of automatic reasoning mechanisms at the field level (`Visualization Layer <=> Text Layer`), automatically converting relationships and deriving transformations at form-level and page-level, thus enabling the automatic generation of the NopTaskFlow's visualization designer without needing to specifically design a dedicated one for NopTaskFlow.

> Additionally, how does NopIoC handle incremental updates with original configurations? Is it using standard tree merge algorithms or custom ones? The efficiency and correctness of this merge process are crucial for application reliability.

Specifically: The Delta Merge Algorithm is independent of the specific DSL and follows the associative property. Another idea is that this Delta approach resembles patch files used in version control systems, allowing modifications without altering the original source code by applying patches. Applying increments to configurations has similarities with this concept.

Specifically: While Delta differences and patch files are fundamentally different. The core difference lies in the fact that Deltas are independent and follow the associative property in their merge operations. Mathematically, Delta merges never result in conflicts, whereas applying patches often leads to format conflicts.

```
App = Base + Patch1 + Patch2
```
A Patch is defined relative to a specific Base. Without knowing anything about the Base, we cannot pre-merge two Patches (Patch1 and Patch2) into one. Instead, both must be applied to a specific Base, and then a single Patch can be derived.

Deltas, on the other hand, are entirely independent of any Base information. Any Delta can be merged with any other Delta regardless of their origin.

```
Delta = Delta1 + Delt2
App = AppBase + Delta
```

For a more comprehensive explanation, refer to my previous article [A Developer's Guide to the Delta Concept: Git and Docker as Examples](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/D5bDNkMJ9gYrFb0uDj2EzQ).

> In terms of security, if incremental files can modify configurations during loading, there is a risk if these files are not properly protected. Unauthorized modifications could lead to security vulnerabilities or unintended application behavior.

Specifically: The Nop platform loads all models and Delta files through a unified model loader. If necessary, it can manage permissions during loading to ensure only authorized changes are allowed.

> How does this integrate with CI/CD pipelines? If increments are managed separately, how do they interact with application code? A clear strategy is needed to handle increments across different environments and ensure the correct increment is applied in each context.

Specifically: This is straightforward. The Nop platform uses a virtual file system to manage all model files, corresponding to the source directory's `resources/_vfs` directory. Within this directory, multiple delta directories can be created. The overall strategy resembles Docker's OverlayFS difference file system.

# Handling Incremental Changes and Rollbacks in NopIoC Configuration

## Problem Analysis

What happens if an increment tries to modify a part of the original configuration file that does not exist? How does NopIoC handle this situation gracefully or does it cause errors?

It would be beneficial to have mechanisms in place, such as ignoring invalid increments or throwing meaningful exceptions.

---

## Solution Explanation

From a theoretical perspective, we need to expand the software structure to allow negative elements. For example, trying to delete a non-existent attribute can simply be recorded as a marker deletion, and upon completion, check if any invalid increment operations exist, which can then be safely removed.

---

## Rollback Scenarios

What about rollback scenarios? If an increment causes issues in production, how easy is it to roll back the changes? Maintaining clear rollback mechanisms for increments is crucial for maintaining stability.

---

## Exploring Delta Customization Support

Another area worth exploring is Delta customization support. Are there any visualization tools or editors that can assist developers in efficiently creating and managing incremental files? Good tools can significantly improve development experience and reduce errors.

---

## Solution Explanation (Delta Customization)

According to reversible computation theory, `A = 0 + A`, any full quantity is a special case of the delta. Therefore, there is no need to differentiate between full quantities and deltas at the editor level. The same tool can be used to manage both full and incremental files.

Nop platform provides an IDEA plugin that reads the root node's `x:schema` metadata from the DSL file to the metadata definition, then implements syntax suggestions, link navigation, etc., based on the metadata definition. Using the metadata information, it knows which parts are code snippets, enabling breakpoint debugging functionality.

---

## Comparison with Other Configuration Management Solutions

Finally, how does NopIoC compare in terms of flexibility and usability to other configuration management solutions? If it provides a more unified and powerful customization method, it could be a valuable addition to a developer's toolkit. However, if it becomes too complex or integrates poorly with existing systems, it may not be worth adopting.

Overall, Delta customization seems to be a promising approach for managing complex application configurations, offering flexibility and maintainability advantages. However, careful consideration of implementation details, practices, and potential challenges is essential to ensure its effective use.

# Understanding Delta Customization in Application Configuration

## Key Considerations

1. **Avoiding Accidental Destruction of Configurations**
   - Ensure that delta changes do not inadvertently modify configurations that are still in use.
   - For example, if a delta removes a `bean` that is still referenced elsewhere, it can lead to runtime errors.

2. **Version Control and Change Management**
   - Proper tracking of deltas becomes crucial when multiple deltas are applied.
   - Understanding which changes originate from each delta helps in managing and debugging configurations effectively.

3. **Integration with Existing Practices**
   - Delta customization appears to be a more versatile method, potentially encompassing existing practices like feature toggles or environment-specific configurations.
   - This allows for fine-grained control over various aspects of application configuration.

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Since delta customization occurs during model loading, it generally does not impact runtime performance.
   - However, the merging process of deltas with base configurations may introduce some overhead during initialization or reconfiguration.

5. **Security Concerns**
   - If deltas can modify configurations in any manner, mechanisms must be in place to ensure only authorized changes are applied.
   - This could involve access control, delta content validation, or tracking who made which changes through audit trails.

## Equation Review

The initial equation **A = 0 + A** was analyzed to understand its implications:
- It represents the process of adding a delta (change) to the base configuration.
- The result is that the final configuration is determined by this combination.
- This perspective shifts from static file-based configurations to dynamic, constructible states based on various inputs.

## Solution Focused Questions

### Problem 1: Understanding Delta Customization
- Delta customization allows for dynamic and modular changes to application configurations.
- It enables building configurations incrementally from different input sources while maintaining modularity.

### Problem 2: Integration with Loading Mechanisms
- The model loader is not merely a mundane parsing function but can be extended to DynamicLoader, capable of handling complex, expandable configurations.
- This approach pushes scalability and extensibility concerns down to the loader level, simplifying overall design.

### Problem 3: Managing Complex Configurations
- Effective management requires tracking deltas separately from base configurations.
- A unified model allows for centralized management of both base and delta configurations, reducing redundancy and increasing maintainability.

## Conclusion

Delta customization represents a powerful and flexible approach to managing application configurations. By enabling fine-grained modifications without altering original code, it provides a robust solution for handling complex configuration scenarios.

# Delta Merge Concept

In this context, deltas seem to stack upon each other, with each delta being relative to the current state of the configuration at application time.

However, the user emphasized that "deltas of deltas are just deltas," which implies that applying a delta and then applying its delta results in no fundamental difference. They are all just deltas.

This could significantly impact how configurations are managed, especially in complex systems that require multi-layer customization.

# Patch vs Delta

From a Patch perspective, there is definitely a bias. Patches are often more straightforward to apply and understand compared to deltas, which can represent more abstract changes.

## Delta Merge Process
1. First, establish a reasoning chain between two structures `A -> D`.
2. Then decompose this reasoning chain into multiple steps: `A -> B -> C -> D`.
3. Finally, deconstruct each step by applying delta decomposition: `A -> _B -> B -> _C -> C -> _D -> D`. According to A, we can derive `_B` and then complete it with delta information to get `B`: `_B + dB = B`.

The Nop platform's Model-Driven Architecture demonstrates this by automatically generating the reasoning process for both frontend and backend code from an Excel data model.

![Delta Pipeline](../tutorial/delta-pipeline.png)

# Implications of Delta Merging
This approach could be very powerful for managing complex configurations, especially in environments where different use cases or tailored configurations are required.

However, it can also become quite complex when many deltas are applied in sequence. Tracking each delta's effect and how they interact with one another can be challenging.

# Technical Considerations
1. **Order of Application**: The order in which deltas are applied can affect the final result. Ensure that the system properly handles this to maintain expected configurations.
2. **Conflict Resolution**: If deltas conflict, what happens? How does the system resolve such conflicts? Since all deltas are treated equally, a conflict resolution strategy might be necessary.

# Delta vs Patch
1. **Delta Merge**: Any two deltas can be merged. This is not generally true for patches, which can only be merged with the base.
2. **Patch Merge**: Patches cannot usually be merged in arbitrary order due to potential conflicts and semantic differences.

This suggests that delta-based approaches might offer more flexibility and ease of use compared to traditional patching methods.

# Example: Delta Application
Consider a Web application's configuration file. You apply a delta to modify database connection settings, then another delta to change the log level. Both deltas are applied to the base configuration.

According to the user's assertion, the second delta is just another delta, not because it's a delta of a delta but because it's a delta itself.

# Advanced Considerations
1. **Order Independence**: If all deltas are just deltas, does the order in which they're applied matter? In theory, no, as long as each delta is applied relative to the current state.
2. **Potential for Infinite Application**: This could imply that you can apply an infinite number of deltas, creating a chain of deltas.

# Conclusion
The core idea here seems to be that all changes are represented as deltas, which allows for a more flexible and uniform approach to configuration management. The Nop platform's implementation demonstrates this concept in practice through its delta pipeline.


In summary, the concept of "the difference of differences is only one difference" illustrates a unified method for applying configuration changes. This approach provides significant flexibility and modularity but requires careful management to address potential complexities such as conflicts, dependencies, and performance impacts.

I should also explore whether existing systems or frameworks have implemented this concept. For example, in software version control, patches are typically applied as differences relative to the base version, and multiple patches can be applied sequentially. This appears to align with the concept under discussion.

Additionally, in database migrations, each migration script can be viewed as a difference that transforms the database schema from one version to another. Applying multiple migrations is akin to applying a series of differences.

These comparisons reinforce the idea that treating differences uniformly could be a powerful approach in configuration management. However, it is crucial to learn from existing systems how they handle challenges related to conflicts, dependencies, and performance optimization.

In conclusion, understanding "the difference of differences is only one difference" is essential for designing flexible and scalable configuration management systems. It allows for modular configuration changes without modifying core configuration files, but a well-thought-out strategy is needed to manage the resulting complexities.
